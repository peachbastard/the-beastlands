###### 
Basic Information 

| **Where** | **Territory** |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Whitelands | [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]] |

- The Salt Palaces are made of the same white stone that gives the Whitelands its name
- A shining white mineral, the city itself actually predates the [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]], but the Junken have claimed it as their capital for a millennia
- There are newer buildings, (easy to tell from non-white rock material), these are mostly built around more impoverished areas close to the two huge gates on either side of the city. 
- The buildings grow larger and more impressive the more into the center of town, giving the city it's name.

**Where:** Whitelands  
**Territory:** [Junken](app://obsidian.md/Junken)
