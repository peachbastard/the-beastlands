# What Happened? 
## Things Fall Apart

- A black orb dripping a dark liquid of some kind at a slow pace lies in place where [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Archmagistrate Vy\|Archmagistrate Vy]] once was
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy]] tries to cast Vicious Mockery on the mushroom bear 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] looks at the bear and sees that it was potentially looking through the eyes of another creature, then critically hits it with an Eldritch Blast 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] is in a panic and tries to get the snake out of her, but fails. She can feel it wiggling between her veins and muscles 
	- She asks Hymn if they can call their dragon down to get the party, but they point out that they wanted to search the library for scrolls, and that they're still deep underground 
	- Mabel picks up the orb with her monk wraps 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] shoots the bear and teleports around the creature 
- The bear roars, then speaks in Common and addresses Mabel:
	- "It's not too late to give up this forlorn path you've chosen. Choose your people. We support the Wizard's Union now, gain power as druids, then we can take over the junken and the Wizard's Union. We can control them all. I've invented fungal strains that can coerce without all this brute violence. We can end this. Not this just this war, but all wars, Mabel"
	- Mabel senses earnestness in his voice, and even some respect after battling the party. She senses worry, not for just his life, but for the future that he sees at stake 
- Mabel looks to the party for help 
	- Hymn says that they don't think that's a regular bear 
	- Sniff says that the firbolg don't deserve all the power either and have lost their way
	- Roy says that he's met a talking bear before that led him astray 
- Roy holds a Vicious Mockery to use if the [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Firbolg Shaman\|Firbolg Shaman]] attacks the party 
- Hymn tries to go around the bear, but it growls. They hold a Vicious Mockery if it attacks 
- Mabel thinks back to when she would explore the family chambers and tries to get the snake out from inside of her; which the bear refers to as "the mark"
- The bear says, "Let no more sacred blood be spilled on these filthy steps"
- Mabel throws the staff at the bear from the [[Lore/Junken\|junken]] and says, "The Psylocibin Clan will live on. It starts with me. And Roy I forgot his last name, Hymn, Snuffle, and Oz. And Lysanderoth or Archibald"
- The bear tells her to kill the interlopers with him, and that she will be a great and terrible queen 
- Sniff shoots at the bear, which prompts it to spew a cloud of fungal poison over the party
- The bear roars and shoots a funnel of mushrooms that overgrow and overtake Sniff; growing from his skin with a strange sentience that beckons him to join their conversation. He his reminded of his loneliness, but his strong sense of independence keeps him from giving in
- Roy says, "That wasn't bear-y nice," and casts Vicious Mockery, but it resists
- Hymn is incredibly wounded and runs out of the room after firing more Eldritch Blasts at the bear
- Mabel isn't harmed at all by the cloud of spores and feels it as a warm, soothing presence. The bear tells her, "Join us before it's too late. Don't lose your people forever. Strike down these government-drunk fools that have spilled our blood. How can you turn a blind eye to their sins?"
	- Mabel has only heard stories of druids that are powerful enough to cast spells in their wild shape, and he's potentially one of them 
- Mabel closes the distance and stuns the bear with an uppercut, repeating, "It starts with me!" 
- Sniff shoots the bear, and he drops his Wild Shape and reverts back to his firbolg form 
- The Shaman says "I'll leave you to your exile. I hope to see my kingdom rise without you. You will be a story for children to listen and laugh at. A bald-headed freak, eaten alive by the snakes I could have gotten out of you if you had let me"
	- He Plane Shifts out of the room; saying before disappears that he can see through every spore
- As she breaths the spores in, a memory returns to Mabel from her time in the village with all of the elders disapproving of her, but the spores from her Symbiotic Entity form helps her shake it off

- Mabel drinks a Potion of Dragon's Majesty and burrows through the underground, grabs Roy and Sniff, and tries to grab Hymn, but they are intent on getting to the library and slip away 
- Mabel insists that she'll give Hymn the nail, but Hymn points out how it didn't work to bring Oz back to life
- Hymn inspects the nail to see if it will have the needed effect
	- They're sure that the nail won't work, and recall that they've robbed this place before  
	- They try to draw from this memory and start frantically looking around for a scroll 
- Hymn picks a lock, but it animates and binds their hands together once they manage to open the door

- Hymn has Sniff take their vial of angel's blood and pour a drop of it on the shackles. It boils, but not enough to melt through 
	- Sniff looks hesitantly at his sword and says he can cut off their hands, but Hymn says they can't do that until Oz is back
- Hymn tells Lysanderoth that he reminds them of [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] 
	-  Sniff says that he would have killed Lysanderoth if he had a chance to meet him, and that he has some of his memories

	- Hymn and Sniff try to argue that they offered to bring him with them to save her
	- Shook says that he was powerful enough to cast ninth level spells, but he never knew when to quit; which is why she left him after their son died 
- Sniff also reveals that the party has a [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Inventory/The Bomb\|bomb]] that could destroy the city; despite Hymn's attempts at stopping him by kicking him in the dick
	- Shook demands to know more about the bomb and says that she'll be Hymn's forever if they help her destroy the city

## The One That Got Away

	- Sniff tries to convince the party to rest in the Archmagistrate's mansion, but Hymn says that they don't want to be where they were just dumped

- Hymn says that they should have stuck with their first love, then backtracks and say that they don't like Oz

		- Sniff says it sounds like Oz was abusive, but Hymn says she was sweet

- Sniff gives [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] the book that Lysanderoth brought him from the [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Places/All Faith's Temple\|All Faith's Temple]], and Arthur blearily says, "Thank you, Bjorn Giantsbane"

	- Hymn declares Sniff the better name 
- Hymn rubs the angel blood on their eyes and memories of their parents come back to them

	- Sniff asks Roy what his wife is doing, and he says that she's watching their kids 
	- Roy mentions that it's been a while since he's babysat his kids, and Hymn calls him out on his wording and says that "babysit" is a word usually reserved for people that aren't the parents. They ask when the last time he was with his children
