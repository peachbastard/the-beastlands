# What Happened? 
## When It Crumbles
- Some kind of old ziggurat structure already down where the party fell 
- After the party's bomb was armed and took on a slightly new shape and is glowing blue
- Three moons circle overhead, and the skeletal clouds start to darkening the light of the moons
- A thud hits the ground, then another. Skeletal bodies start pouring forth from the sky and start swarming together and form a new larger body near the rocky protrusion the party is on
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Captain Janken\|Janken]] swears and shouts commands to his remaining men, "We must clear this place for the ceremony"
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] grabs [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] and runs past the large undead and says to the [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Evil Firbolg\|other firbolg]], "You know, I thought the next time I saw another firbolg it would be with open arms"
	- She runs up to Janken and tries to interpose herself between him and [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Oz\|Oz's]] body, then uses her [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Inventory/Paintbrush Staff\|Paintbrush Staff]] to try to blind him
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] shoots the giant undead with a radiant arrow that seems particularly effective 
- Jorgen the paladin raises his sword to the sky, utters an oath under his breath, then strikes out at the shambling hoard of skeletons and leaves a large gash
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] runs then casts Misty Step to appear behind Janken and tries to cast Levitate on him
- Another one of Janken's [[Lore/D.E.D.\|D.E.D.]] runs over to Arthur and Misty Steps with him to the top of the ziggurat, then fires a his gun at the skeleton
- Fresh bodies keep raining from the clouds above 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy Valentine]] casts Shatter on the skeleton and Jorgen, but takes necrotic damage in the process from the aftereffects of his previous Wish spell 
- The skeleton charges Sniff and all of the individual hands that make up its body try to pick up anyone it can. Sniff dodges, but [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Shook\|Shook]] is captured 
- The firbolg reaches out with his wooden prosthetic arm. Insects swarm out of it and hurt Roy as he tells him to get out of their way 
- Mabel thinks of her mother getting stabbed by Janken and savagely cracks down on him with her staff 
- Mabel feels a sensation come over her that she's felt before when practicing her wild shape magic, then finds her body changing uncontrollably into a boar by a True Polymorph spell
- Sniff teleports around shooting arrows at Janken's men
- Jorgen Misty Steps to Sniff and smites him 

## Hog Wild
- Hymn turns to Janken and tells him that they think he wants to ascend to godhood and has deluded all these people into thinking he has good intentions. 
	- Janken replies, "I have no delusions about godhood. It's nothing but more power. Power is something that many men have had. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to save countless lives."
- Hymn asks who he was saving by casting them out onto the streets. "Our father told us this. One of us was doomed to end the world. The other destined to save it. And I knew then as I know now. You are the death of hope, Hymn"
- Hymn tries to cast Levitate on Janken again, but he uses a legendary resistance 
- The gunman pulls out a small gatling gun-like instrument. The color changes slightly with each shot and causes different types of elemental damage to Sniff
- Roy says to Janken, "I mustache you why you're doing this," but Janken resists the Vicious Mockery
- The skeleton rushes at Roy and the hands try to grab at him. Parts of Shook's face and arm can be seen subsumed within it
	- It then slams its almost liquid arm down on Roy and nearly pushes him off the cliff, but he's barely able to hang on
- The firbolg stands over Roy and looks him in the eye and points down at him and says "I was saving this spell for the other firbolg", but Hymn Counterspells him 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Pill\|Pill]] lets out a piercing scream and light floods the darkness and he lets loose a burst of energy at the firbolg, pushing him far off into the chasm. He lets out white, flame-like light that he can't seem to stop
- Janken says, "You fools! The vessel can't be awakened until the ritual ... You've even brought a backup arcane child"
	- He then says that these instructions have been provided to him by god, the only god remaining 
- Roy is able to nimbly pull himself up from the cliffside, but is immediately distracted by Pill's piercing screeches 
	- He tells Pill, "Don't worry, everyone's bodies go through changes"
	- He tries to cast Vicious Mockery on Janken, but he resists 
- Mabel as a boar is scared and jumps off the cliff onto the ground below
- Sniff Misty Steps, then shoots Jorgen with a normal arrow 
	- He then teleports and hits the skeleton with a radiant arrow 
	- He teleports again to shoot the gunman
- Sniff is close enough to the paladin to hear his whispered prayer as he brings his sword down, crackling with black lightning 
- Although everyone has been dealing damage to it, the large skeleton appears to be healing from the skeletons falling from the sky 
- Hymn casts Levitate on Shook to pull her out of the skeleton
	- They then Misty Step behind Oz's body. Janken tries to Counterspell it, but Roy Counterspells him

## We Will Stand Tall
- Janken says, "You don't know why you're doing this"
	- Hymn responds, "I don't know anything about the geopolitics of this area, but Oz is the only one that's stuck up for me"
- Janken says, "[[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/General Falconhein\|General Falconhein]] has allied himself with an army of fire elementals led by [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Lily Hazelheart\|Lily Hazelheart]]. You're all just a part of his power ploy. At least I took the bull by its horns when I worked for the [[Lore/Junken\|junken]]. I wasn't just a sheep tagging along for a fun time while people died"
	- Hymn responds, "So you just killed Mabel's people for fun"
	- Janken retorts, "I didn't kill them for fun, they were going to kill millions of people. I bear proof!" He tears open the buttons of his shirt revealing a mark and says, "Reach out with your magic and you'll know the truth"
- A shot rings out and misses Sniff. The gunman falls to his knees and loads up a large cannon-like gun
- Roy tells Hymn that they don't need to thank him for the Counterspell because he thinks of them as the child he's never had, then says he has to make this one count. He drinks the potion of maximum damage from Mabel, then casts Shatter on the gunman and the skeleton
	- The spell damages him and causes him to briefly go unconscious, but he gets back up with his Relentless Endurance
- Janken grabs Hymn and takes the sword from their hands and says, "I really must start wrapping things up"
- The area grows darker and darker as the skull clouds descend into the hole and green smoke pours out of their eyes. They suddenly burst and a screaming skull with bejeweled eyes wreathed in flames that burns like a sun appears
	- Janken is knocked back by the skull descending, but Hymn is able to resist
- The skull screams, "Bring me the boy! You all meddle in affairs you can't possibly fathom. There's one true follower of the last god here, and it is I"
	- Roy and Mabel are blinded by the light
- Blinded, Mabel rams into a wall to try to damage herself, then runs up the stairs 
- Sniff Misty Steps to where the gunman was, picks up his loaded cannon and shoots the skeleton with it 
	- The cannon projects a blazing white-hot stream of molten glassy material inlaid with different colors
- Hymn hops down to the lower tier of the ziggurat that Janken fell down to try to steal it from him. As they sneak around the corner, Janken silently points the sword at them as he leans against the wall 
	- Hymn tries to grab it out of his hands, but finds themselves in a standstill as Janken holds on
  - Roy tells Pill that this is his chance to save his friends and to be become a hero that he sings songs about 
	  - The white flames dim and Pill turns to the skeleton and unleashes them against it 
- The paladin leaps down the ledge onto Sniff and knocks him unconscious 
- Mabel rams the skeleton, but then the hands of the body pull her into it. She feels sharp bones digesting her, then takes enough damage to come out of the boar form
	- Mabel matches the pitch of Pill's scream sand summons satyrs to help 
	- With that same scream, she uses Healing Word on Sniff to bring him back up
- Sniff reloads the glass cannon and Misty Steps close to Roy and Pill
- Session ends as Hymn is able to rend the sword from Janken's hands, then casts Levitate on themselves to float back to the top of the ziggurat and start casting the ritual
