- Party treks through some difficult terrain with relative difficulty

- Lysanderoth says that Hymn could knock on the door and say that they're looking for their dad, but Hymn vehemently denies that the [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Captain Janken\|blue tiefling]] is their dad 
	- Says that they'd rather choose the hot woman than the deadbeat dad either way
- Everyone consumes a Potion of Invisibility, then Hymn knocks on the cover 
	- An opening appears, then a ball of fire bursts through, harming Hymn and Mabel, and causing the latter to drop her invisibility 
		- She turns into a rat in her panic
