# What Happened? 
## Firbolg vs. Firbolg
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Evil Firbolg\|Firbolg]] in leather trench coat and leather hat stands in blown up entrance to the cave and says, "You've come for my father. You're too late."
	- Looks at [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] with fury in his eyes
	- Dark clouds form over the firbolg and over the party, and he calls the party filthy SSP agents 
- Mabel is a noble, wants to see if she recognizes anything about this guy 
	- Not anyone she recognizes from her villages a child 
	- Very possible that he's a spores druid 
- Fluffs up hair and says "By order of Psilocybin Clan, back down!" then smacks him with her staff when he scoffs 
	- His skin grows over with a tough bark  
	- She asks who his father is 
		- He says, "Don't play coy with me. As if you don't know."
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] tries to charms him with their cuteness and a Charm Person spell, but he calls them an imposter 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] slices off one of his arms off in a whirlwind of sword strikes 
	- The man pulls out an amulet that turns into a black sphere 
	- A portal suddenly opens behind him
	- There's a desperate shout: "NO!"
	- Another man, smaller in another black leather trench coat and tricorn hat, but with bluish features and a long tail; grabs the firbolg, yanks him back into the portal behind him, hurls another bomb at the party, then disappears 


## Mrs. Officer
- Hymn sends their imp down the tunnel and sees some more men waiting for them with [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Shook\|Shook]] tied up in a chair 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Oz\|Oz]] heals Hymn and says, "You can't save the girl if you're dead."
- Oz pulls Mabel aside and says, "You have the most skin in the game, and if things go south... you don't have a chip in you."
	- Hands her a giant diamond worth 5000 GP and says to keep it in case one of them dies, then walks away  
- Hymn uses Command through their sprite to get the two to come to the entrance, and the party starts fucking them up
	- The two are a human and half-elf who refuse to talk about who sent them
	- One of them uses a strange mechanical weapon that punctures Lysanderoth multiples times in the abdomen 
		- He says, "Down with the [[Lore/Sorcerers' Union\|Sorcerers' Union]] 
		- Takes something in a pouch in a necklace he's wearing and swallows it
- Mabel sees that the bombs used are of [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]] make 
- Hymn sends sprite down invisibility to distract the man, then mage hands his giant bomb away
	- Brings the ticking bomb in front of the party, but Lysanderoth is able to disarm it in time
- Shook says, "I knew you would come," and has the last remaining man trapped under her 
	-  She reveals that she is not a bartender, is an agent for the Sorcerer's because no one would suspect a busy half-orc
	- She also reveals that they've been aware of the lich, but don't see it as a problem
	- Captured man has heavy scars over his ears 
- Oz casts Zone of Truth on everyone in the room, and the man fails, but they have a hard time communicating with him 
	- Oz uses Sending to ask if who sent him, if Janken is Hymn's dad, and why they're after the bartender 
	- The man responds through the Sending, refuses to answer the questions and says that he's dead man anyways
	- Oz slits his throat, to Shook's annoyance, waits a moment, then casts Revivify on him
		- Before she casts Revivify, she whispers something in the man's ear
		- He returns to life looking visibly shaken and defeated 
- Hymn uses Minor Illusion to show words for him to respond to 
	- The man conveys that [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Captain Janken\|Captain Janken]] killed the chief of the firbolg, is the captain of their [[Lore/D.E.D.\|D.E.D.]] squad, saved one baby and made him his son after destroying the whole civilization
	- Says that firbolgs are ultra nationalists
- Party debates on whether or not to kill him, but Shook needs someone to bring back for questioning since the sting had failed and Janken got away  
	- The party offers to bring the man in for her 
- Shook gives Hymn an item to present to any People Unions police station to hold the prisoner captive, and to get in touch with Shook

## The Marshmallow Room 
- Party spends the hour walking back to town plotting on how to get the bomb 
- Hymn is despondent and not sure if they should keep pursuing Shook 
	- Oz says that they're star-crossed lovers like Romeo and Juliet 
- They eventually decide on having Mabel use  Enhance Ability on the imp, having it sneak in invisibly, then dumping the contents of the bag of holding into Hymn's Demiplane 
	- Hymn creates a Demiplane that has soft padding on the ground and walls
- After a lot of deliberating, party is able to carry out the above plan 
	- They leave the actual bag behind, dump the contents of that bag and a [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Inventory/Bag of Devouring\|mysterious black linen bag]] into the marshmallow room, then have the imp return back to the party 


## Night 4
- Party returns to the tavern to find [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Pill\|Pill]] yelling in a high-pitched voice while three men fight in the middle of the room
	- Pill says that it was terrible, and that the men took the money out of the register and started fighting each other
	- Hymn levitates the men into separate corners of the room, then shakes a red-headed one upside down until coins fall out of his pockets
	- Oz and Hymn make the man apologize to Pill
- Party sees that [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] is now the size of 5-6 year old and is reading multiple scrolls 
	- He says that he won them off of some travelers while they were gone, and that he really likes winning 
	- Hymn asks if he can show them what he can do, but he says that he's not ready yet because he wants it to be perfect 
- Session ends as the party contemplates how to pull of their second consecutive heist and steal the lich's wand
