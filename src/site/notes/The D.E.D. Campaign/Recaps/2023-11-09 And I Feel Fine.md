# What Happened? 
## Love Returned 

- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Captain Janken\|Captain Janken]] has similar bone structure to Hymn, but very different looks in their eyes
	- He is followed by several formidable looking figures with unique armor and weapon configurations and [[Lore/D.E.D.\|D.E.D.]] patches on their right arms
- Notably there is a firbolg with a wooden prosthetic arm 
- Janken has a sack with something wiggling and says, "I think you misplaced something."
	- He upends the sack and reveals the [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Doorguard\|Doorguard]], who begs to be freed
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] asks what he wants with the party 
- Janken says, "At first I thought it was strange... The fact that all of a sudden, I run into another D.E.D. with a blue tiefling and firbolg. First I thought maybe it was a trick, but after following and watching, I became fairly confident that there's nothing so sophisticated going on. Just some play from Falconhein.... to seize power over what's left of the junken"
	- He says, "He was this close to coming up with a chemical compound that would have had the junken and the whole world at his feet. Maybe he's back to his old games if he's been shielding a royal from the tribe this whole time."
- Mabel concedes to the chemical that the junken were working on, then says she wishes she had some of it so she could stab him with it. 
- Mabel closes the distance to stab Janken while Hymn yells for her to stop 
	- She yells that she doesn't work for them anymore, and that she's free 
- A young but grim faced woman holding a helmet and lifting a gauntleted fist with dead eyes casts a spell that inflicts the most intense waves of pain that Mabel has ever felt 
	- Mabel falls to her knees 

## There's An Endless Road to Rediscover
- Janken says that he had no idea that his men were so sloppy that they left someone behind, besides his only weakness: [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Evil Firbolg\|his adopted son]] that they maimed 
	- He says that she could have been nicer to her brother, and since he saw fit to slice his arm off he would return the favor and slice off hers 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] says they'll slice off Mabel's arm herself if he answers if he's his father or cousin
- Mabel's arm is ripped off telekinetically 
- Hymn asks again if he's their dad. He says it's been a long time since he's laid his eyes on them, and calls them his little sibling 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] sees that they're very similar in age 
- Mabel tells the firbolg with the wooden arm that it's people like him that caused the invasion
- Hymn asks why they were abandoned, and he asks if they know nothing of their bloodline 
	- Janken asks if it would make a difference to them. He says, "One was conceived and born normally, the other was cut from the stomach. Our father sacrificed our mother's life for you because she was a devil. And his holier than thou lineage that he droned on and on about up until the very moment I slit hit throat. About the great prophecy of angels in his bloodline, and the failures of the Aasimar"
- Janken says he refuses to share their birthright and will drink Hymn's blood if it meant becoming a god 
	- He tells them to look up in the sky where two and a half moons hang, then says there's a secret fourth moon. He tells Hymn. "Perhaps I did you a favor by abandoning you in the woods"
- Janken says he will be taking the sword, then ponders, "I wonder what forces have manipulated you here. Or do you really think this is all a coincidence?"
- Janken says to Roy, "I don't know who you are, but it's unfortunate that you have to die here"
	- Hymn says yells for him to leave their new dad alone 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy Valentine]] casts Shatter on Janken and a group of his forces  
- Hymn tries to cast Circle of Death on Janken and the people around him, but one of his cronies casts Counterspell
	- Roy tries to Counterspell the Counterspell, but is Counterspelled
- Hymn says, "You just hated me for my whimsy. You always knew I'd be the cuter one, didn't you?"
- Sniff says that he's killed monsters that Janken hasn't even heard of 
	- Janken asks who he is, and Sniff just spits to the side and shoots an arrow at him

## Then You're The Fool, I'm Just As Well
- Mabel turns into a pearlescent moonstone dragon and comes down on Janken and tries to stun him
	- Janken laughs and says that it's fitting after having them do the dirty work of killing the dragon that he now has to kill one 
- Sniff talks about having killed a dragon when he was 12, and Hymn fist bumps him 
- A crown of stars rises over Janken that are almost blinding to the eye 
	- He turns towards Mabel and one of the jewel-like stars from his crown flies at her. Mabel roars in rebuttal
- A heavily-armored person rushes to the front and unsheathes a huge cannon-esque device. A burst of flame comes out, but Mabel's able to dodge it with her monk finesse 
- A man with a rapier in one hand and a glow of magic in the other that pulls a spell slot from Roy
- Hymn fires Eldritch Blasts at Janken and tells him, "Say hi to mom"
	- Giant gates appear behind him and chains lash out and hurl him through hell
- The dark armored mage lets out a piercing wail and the party is silenced 
- Sniff fires arrows at the armored mage
- Mabel lets out a silent roar then releases her breath weapon against them 
- A tall, brightly-armored man runs up to Mabel and attacks her 
	- He summons forces from above him that fall into his glowing blade, and she feels the heat of 1,000 suns pierce through her
- The druid laughs at Mabel and says "If you must rely on our people's magic; I guess I won't hold back either"
	- He then changes shape and turns into a wooly mammoth 
- Hymn levitates out of the sphere of silence and turns the phase spider into a bench, then lands near [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Oz\|Oz's]] body
- One of the D.E.D. members suddenly disappears, then Roy feels like the heart of his magic has been spoiled 
- Roy pulls out his lute and plays a silenced riff, then swings wildly at the armored mage with it. He misses entirely and does a little spin with the momentum 
- Mabel flies above the D.E.D. with Roy in tow and tries to put the group to sleep, but they all resist 
- The D.E.D. member that disappeared reappears near Hymn and fires at them with a blunderbuss 
	- Hymn retaliates with an icy Hellish Rebuke 
- Hymn asks Janken what mom said, and he replies, "She said she never loved you"
- Janken says "You know how I believe in fairness.  Let me know show you what you've been missing all those years you've been using that pathetic spell"
	- He hits Hymn with an Eldritch Blast and hurls them through hell 

## Brother, My Brother 
- The skulls of the clouds grow and seem to have turned their gaze inward to the courtyard of the [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Places/All Faith's Temple\|All Faith's Temple]] 
- Roy casts Shatter and cracks break into the earth 
- Lightning starts to flash into the water from the clouds
- Mabel carries Roy towards the center of the battlefield and tries to grapple Janken along the way, but he's too slippery and gracefully darts between her claws 
- The druid wooly mammoth tries to knock Roy and Mabel prone, but they stand firm. It tries to cross the river and is burnt alive by the water
- Hymn returns from hell badly wounded, but still conscious
- Roy nimbly uses the mammoth as a platform to leap to the other side of the bridge, scans the area and takes in the badly wounded party 
	- He says, "I wish the party was okay and healed," and casts Wish to heal everyone to full health and regrows Mabel's arm 
- The ground splits around the party and they fall through the earth 
- The bomb seems to shift gears as they party plumets to a strange cave where Janken stands with a glowing bomb and Oz's body 
- The Doorguard falls onto a splintered rock and dies
- Janken says, "Hymn. I see now. We must rule as twin gods. Like the first peoples. Bring forth the items in your pockets. 
- Hymn refuses and says that he'll just throw them out onto the streets of heaven and leave them to fend for the scraps of the gods.
- Janken says, "Man needs to be ruled. Better a just god than the hungry things that lurk beneath us"
	- He points out Jorgen the paladin that worships a dead god, but from it can summon a power that they've never seen
	- He says, "I've also made a pact with that god. A living god that's survived all this time and guided my blade to this very moment and won't let me fail"
- Janken says the people of Foghaven must be destroyed. "They're beyond saving. They've drank from the river tainted by the old gods themselves"
- Hymn retaliates, "A god that doesn't believe in the salvation of all isn't a just god. I don't want to become a god. I won't stand for a bomb killing all these innocent people." 
- Janken laughs and says, "You poor, poor child. This is beyond your pretty morality. I've sucked at the serpent's cup and seen what there is to see"
- Hymn tries to convince Janken's remaining acolytes to turn against him, saying that their comrades lay dead at Janken's feet and he doesn't care  
	- Jorgen says that Janken has saved millions of lives by taking the virus within himself, then he was chosen by a god and brought back
- Jorgen asks if they saw the people on the streets and says that it was caused by the darkness of the river upstream 
	- He says, "We scryed as you all broke open the crust of the world that runs from the Seven River Peaks and let loose ancient evils who have already subjugated and poisoned this new society. Janken can't kill an innocent citizen in this city because you killed all of them"
- Session ends as Jorgen asks Hymn if their god would forgive them for being stupid, and Hymn closes their eyes and reaches out to [[Lore/The Hanged God\|The Hanged God]]
