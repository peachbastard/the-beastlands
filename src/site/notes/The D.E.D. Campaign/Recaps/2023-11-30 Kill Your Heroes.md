# What Happened? 
## No Need To Worry 
- Red and blue light flashes that momentarily stuns everyone
- Nothing around seems familiar, seems to be standing on a solid substance with an ether mist surrounding
- The god-like embodiment of [[Lore/The Hanged God\|The Hanged God]] still stands who says, "This is your last chance to shape this energy as you would. It's power has not yet erupted over this unsuspecting supplicants over Foghaven. With sufficient power it can still be molded to do anything."
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] still has the artifacts in them and asks Janken why they're still not a god, who responds that they're still outside of time 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Captain Janken\|Janken]] says, "I haven't even told you the truth about the creature hat stands before us."
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] tries to pin down Janken, but he easily steps aside and says that he liked her better as a pig 
- Janken mentions [[Lore/Goathead\|Goathead]], says that he used to follow him and says that he used to go as the god of gifts. He's been a ruthless manipulator for centuries, if not eternity. Turns to the god and asks, "What did cost to become one of the dreamers. What was the price?""
- The god says, "Everything" and a surge of white energy erupts over Janken and knocks him back and roasts him in fire
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Oz\|Oz]] casts Sunbeam and asks what he knows about Goathead. She is told, "Embrace me, my loyal follower. Do you not recognize your own god?"
	- Oz says, "I already said I'll embrace you. Just let them go"
	- The god responds, "I'm afraid sacrificing yourself might not help this time"
- Hymn pulls out their waterskin and douses the flames surrounding Janken. Much of his body is horribly burnt. Half of his jacket and the metal breastplate beneath it has been singed away. 
	- They then take out their potion of angel blood and puts a drop on their tongue 
	- They then pour some of it on Janken's eyes, and he stops writhing in pain 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] takes a potion of healing and is barely standing as he loads his glass cannon 
- Mabel tries to bite off Janken's legs so he can't run off, but Hymn interposes themselves between them
- Hymn tells her to back off their brother, and Mabel responds, "I told you he was going to die"
- Janken tries to whisper something in Hymn's ear 

## Cause Everybody Dies
- The god says to Mabel, "Have you decided then to serve me? I am a god, after all. The last old god"
- Mabel says she can hang a picture up and burn some incense, and the god tells her to kill the tieflings and bathe him in their blood 
	- Mabel offers it her swamp, says it's kind of nice 
- Oz says no one's killing the tieflings, then the god shoots a black beam of energy at her and knocks her unconscious 
	- The god says "Your friends went through a lot to bring you back for nothing"
- Hymn picks up Janken and gives her their last healing potion, then casts Eldritch Blast at the god. The god winces in annoyance and says, "Oh, Hymn. Just like your father"
- Sniff asks [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] if he has any spells that would hurt the god 
	- Arthur nods and starts saying something that sounds like backwards Common as he reads from the page
	- Sniff then Misty Steps in front of the party and shoots the god with his glass cannon 
		- As he walks back, an inky black skeletal hand grabs at him from the surrounding goo. He can see shifting scenes that looks like Foghaven 
- Mabel says, "Maybe we can make a compromise."
- He reaches up and a meteor falls out of the sky and hits Mabel 
- Oz asks who the fuck the old man is, and Hymn says that he saved them all and she wouldn't be alive if it weren't for him 
	- Oz casts Raise Dead on [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy Valentine]], who comes back up with a wheeze 
	- Sniff asks how many papers he's signed, and Roy says, "None! I'm married. Happily, sometimes"
- Roy casts Mass Healing Word on the party 
- Hymn casts Finger of Death. The god tries to Counterspell it, but Roy Counterspells that 

## No More Destination
- "I'm sure you can't appreciate the fact that the first gods warred with the dragons that ruled over man until the Third Sundering. Now they're coming back, as was foretold. You'll be the first to taste my wrath"
	- He motions to one of the larger black holes and a larger creature comes out and attacks Mabel, who is also blinded by the god 
- Oz casts Guiding Bolt at the god 
- Roy casts another Mass Healing Word on the party 
- Hymn casts Blight on the god, then its pearly skin starts melting away 
- Arthur says, "I wish I had more of this book. It was all about this, but it had a bunch of pages torn out"
- Janken tries to whisper something to Sniff. Sniff riffles through his pockets and finds pages, which he hands to Arthur
- Arthur starts chanting from the pages, and the god starts holding its eyes and ears
- As the god's skins melts, its appearance becomes more and more horrible 
	- "I would've given everything you promised and more, you fools. You'll die for the biggest nothing of all time. In fact, you won't even die, for your consciousness will be held together. Eternally punished within the gnashing teeth of the blackness"
- Mabel asks Sniff if anything good would come from jumping in one of the portals, but he's apprehensive as he sees the image of the party on the streets in one of them 
- Mabel tries to frighten the god and the creatures, but they're immune 
- The god charges at the party and nearly knocks Mabel over. He grips her with his clawed hands and says, "I'm going to rip you wing-from-wing and drop you into the bottomless abyss"
	- It spits a black glob of inky substance at Hymn that starts growing into human shapes similar to the ones coming out of the black holes 
- The other inky monstrosities start walking towards Hymn
- "Enough of this charade. I made you, Oz. Hymn. Janken." and they feel the powers granted to them by their patron start to be whisked away
- Sniff shoots the god and the inky monstrosities, and sees that attacks seem to be more effective as Arthur chants 
- Hymn holds out their split tongue and says, "I hate you! What do you mean? You want to give me my spell slots back"
	- The god says, "I'm afraid your paltry little tricks won't work here, Hymn"
- Janken tugs at Hymn and tries to say something to them, but they're too weak 
- The god jumps on top of Mabel and she drops out of dragon form as it leaks out golden blood from its torso 
- Oz listens to Arthur chant and can make out that he's saying something about closing the doors beneath and in the sky, then misses with a Guiding Bolt
- Hymn pulls out a bazooka from Janken's pocket and inspects it. They see that it's made of silver with some sort of script written down the sides in a mix of Abyssal, Infernal, and Celestial 
	- They fire the bazooka, which pierces one of the wounds that have already been opened and splatters the party with foul-smelling gold blood. They can see snakes escaping the wounds, then high-five Janken 

## No More Pain
- Mabel drinks a healing potion, then runs to hide behind a rock and is attacked by the god as she retreats 
	- Mabel casts Conjure Woodland Beings and summons eight blink dogs
- Another Meteor Storm hits Oz, Arthur, Sniff, and Hymn; knocking Arthur and Roy out 
- Oz gently shakes Arhur and says, "Keep reading, buddy" then casts Cure Wounds on him
- Arthur asks if he can have Mr. Valentine's soul when he dies, and Sniff says he won't need it 
	- He says that he saw the giant snake at the end of the tunnel 
- Sniff fires at the god and misses. He promises Arhur all the souls he wants if he keeps reading. This seems to invigorate him, and he starts to read louder 
- The horned god has to hold his stomach closed to keep it from bleeding over and tries to cast Power Word Kill on Hymn, but they swat it out of the air 
- Oz says, "I didn't bring you back from the dead for nothing" and brings Roy back up with Cure Wounds 
- Roy tries to cast Vicious Mockery on the god, but it resists

## Fly, Fly, Baby, Don't Cry
- Wings sprout from Hymn's back and they cast Shatter on the god 
	- They say, "Do I look like my mother?"
- Mabel heals herself, then casts Chill Touch on the god
- The god spews foul-smelling blood and its organs out and screams, "It's not possible! It was foretold!" then brings its claws down on Hymn and brings another meteor down
- Oz casts Bless on herself, Mabel, and Hymn 
- Hymn presses the bazooka into Janken's hands and says, "Brother, if you don't shoot this bazooka I'll send you back to the womb that we came from"
	- They then cast Vampiric Touch on the god 
- Session ends as the god wraps one of its bony claw and almost instantly kills Hymn, but Oz's Death Ward kicks in
