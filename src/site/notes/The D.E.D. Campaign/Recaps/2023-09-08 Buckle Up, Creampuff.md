- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Oz\|Oz]] casts Guiding Bolt on it and crits 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] misses three times even with the advantage because she's still upset over learning about Lysanderoth's actions 
- Empty sockets in inky black skin stare Oz down and she takes a lot of psychic damage and is stunned 
- Mabel smashes the statues to tiny pieces with her staff 
	- What remains of the black flesh dribbles across the store in long streams into an object on a pedestal in the back of the room

	- Several crumbling pages with writing in Abyssal 
	- Lysanderoth takes it for [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] 
	- Small printed stamp on the back of it, simple serpentine patterns
- Mabel looks around for Druidic writing and sees a small red capped mushroom that she knows to be part of a secret language in spores circle 
	- Means something similar to a marker for having passed through an area planted a long time ago, around the time she was born
	- Harvests one 
- Goes through series of short but twisted hallways before standing on crumbling stone, the walls turner redder and warmer 
	- Hymn licks the walls and its disgusting 
	- Pulls out a small paper with a list of places they've licked the walls at and how they rank them and shows it to Lysanderoth 
- Oz sees that the red parts of the walls are living creatures fused together (devils)

	- She says that it's for courage 
- [[The D.E.D. Campaign/Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] talks about how they're grateful that their god doesn't do evil stuff, and has just them steal stuff for good in a quirky way

- Oz dashes forward

		- Oz asks "the world's best thief" for help, and Hymn looks over her shoulder and offer advice
			- She pulls out an old, but well taken care of set of thieves' tools kit and easily dispatches the strange protrusion that would have spat acid out
- Oz calls Hymn the world's third best thief, and they pointedly ignore her 
	- They secretly expend all of their luck points stealing something from Oz
- Oz spots something shiny in a geyser of necrotic sludge that damages her from being in its vicinity
- Hymn sees the shiny thing with Oz's assistance and tries to send their Mage Hand in, but the sludge is too thick. They send in their pseudodragon, but it's not dexterous enough and dies instantly as its bombarded by the sludge

- Lysanderoth is proud for saving Mabel, and Oz sarcastically asks if it makes up for killing her entire civilization 
	- He asks if it does; and instead of answering, Mabel finds a spot away from the rest of the party and meditates 
- Oz says that she doesn't care if he's not sorry, but to not make Mabel cry

	- Oz reiterates that she doesn't care *if* he's not sorry, or that Mabel's people are dead 
- Hymn says that they should get a therapist or four, and Oz says fuck that 
- Hymn casts Scrying:
	- First casts it on [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Shook\|Shook]] and sees that she is still imprisoned
	- Casts it on [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Captain Janken\|Captain Janken]] and sees a figure almost facing directly at their perspective, but with a large broad hat obscures his face besides two sharp blue horns that stick straight up
		- Has a black mustache and smokes a cigarette
			- He says, "I want you to know that I'm coming and I want you to know that you fucked up" straight to the scrying orb 
			- He adds, "[[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/General Falconhein\|Falconhein]] or whoever you're working for should have never sent another crew," then forcibly dismisses the scry

- The upper half of the creature's body suddenly explodes 
- The [[The D.E.D. Campaign/NPC/Mystery Half-Orc\|Half-Orc]] from the bar comes into view and says, "Where do you get off copying Janken's [[Lore/D.E.D.\|D.E.D.]] group like that?" saying that his is the only one with a blue tiefling and a firbolg
	- Hymn says Janken may be their dad, but he says he doesn't see a resemblance beyond being blue tieflings
- Session ends as the party takes in the new arrival
