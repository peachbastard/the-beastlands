## What Happened? 
## Blight Rail
- Party is on a capillary track, smaller railroad
	- Rails will get smaller and smaller until we get closer to a big one
	- Moving through the swampy lands of the Hinterlands 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] apologizes for the conversation getting heated earlier, but does note that they were talking about a bomb

>[!redacted]

- Hymn tries to lighten up the mood and pulls out the black Bag of Holding they found from the last town's commissary office and says that they could see what's in it
	- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] proposes that they all put their hand in and pick something out at random
- Hymn's hand goes numb after reaching inside, then pulls it out and finds it completely obliterated and mostly cauterized 
	- They go to the back of the car and start crying, completely demoralized 
		- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] follows and asks if it's their first time, and gestures with her missing hand; both are now missing their left hands 
			- Hymn says that they're twins now, and Oz says, "Not for long," and casts Regenerate on them
		- Hymn asks why she didn't do that for her hand, and Oz responds that she was going to, but then this all happened
- Train squeaks to a stop and there's a commotion 
- A man enters with a young boy who aims a blunderbuss at the party  
	- The man holds up a bomb and says that there's a forecast of blood fog coming up, and they don't want to be in it without a train 
	- Oz says that she's fine with chancing the blood fog and finds the robbery fucking boring, but Hymn says that they should comply to see what's happening in the front where everyone is all gathered 
- Party is led down the train down a line where a large man dressed better than the rest of the shabby-looking thieves holds a large, rune-inscribed cleaver, and tells them to empty out their pockets
	- Hymn tries to Misty Step, but he swings a cleaver and cuts the weave of their magic and they're only able to travel half of their intended distance
- Oz asks why they're robbing this train
	- Man says that they're on an official mission to search it for an artifact, and will take everyone's valuables as taxes
- Hymn manages to shove the leader's arm into the black Bag of Holding and cuts it off 
	- He tries to retaliate, but [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] smirks and uses his cloud rune to redirect the attack to one of the other bandits, and he decapitates him 
	- Hymn casts Blight on the leader, man looks really hurt
	- Mabel punches who she believes to be a robber, but is actually an innocent old man
		- The man is knocked out immediately, and a young boy cries and says that she killed her grandpa 
		- Mabel apologizes and punches the leader while the boy sobs
	- Oz casts Zone of Truth on him, and he confesses that the [[Lore/Sorcerers' Union\|Sorcerers' Union]] put them up to it, and they are looking for a crystal vessel with some sort of organ in it 
		- Oz says she'll keep an eye out for it for him, then stabs him in the eye with her dagger
	- Mabel creates some vines that reach through the window and bind the incapacitated man

## Brain Drain
- Hymn asks Oz if she can bring the conductor back to the life, or if she can drive a train
	- Oz says that she can definitely drive the train, and can do so in her sleep 
	- Hymn goes to search the leader's belongings
	- Mabel asks Oz if she can bum a cigarette and she goes off to have a smoke and think
	- When they're both gone, Oz has a small panic while she tries to figure out how to operate a train
- Oz casts Speak with Dead to ask the conductor how to run the train, and is able to get it going, but not well-controlled 
- Hymn returns and says that they have a gift for Oz, but not to take it the wrong way, then hands her a diamond to resurrect the conductor with
	- Oz looks really confused and asks why she would take this the wrong way, and Hymn responds that they're not getting married 
- Oz whispers something into the corpse's ear, then casts Raise Dead on the conductor, who comes back severely weakened, but can still operate the train
	- Mabel returns and is enthralled by all the different mechanics and levers and tries to take it all in, watches him intently for four hours
- The train requires coal to run, which Lysanderoth and Hymn must shovel by default due to Oz's missing hand 
- Oz investigates the caboose and finds a safe blown open with two dead bandits lying next to it 
	- Inside is something large covered in an ancient-looking cloth
	- She uses her x-ray vision to peer through the cloth and sees the crystal vessel with the organ inside—looks almost like a [[Inventory/Crystal Brain\|brain]] 
	- Oz tries to return to the front of the train, gets hurt by the blood fog, then decides to turn back to the caboose and uses Sending to tell Hymn to meet her in the back
- Hymn heads towards the back, but first summons a Fire Elemental inside the furnace, causing the train to move faster 
	- As they go towards the back they enter the blood fog area and get hurt
- Oz shows Hymn the cloth-covered vessel, and they say that they can use Detect Magic on it, but it would make the Fire Elemental disappear, so they decide to wait out the hour 
- Oz sees how hurt Hymn is, touches them, and casts Cure Wounds. They thank her and say that they're not as sturdy as the rest of the party 
	- Hand still on Hymn, Oz casts Death Ward on them, then pulls away
	- Oz talks about the bomb, says that she told them that she wouldn't make them steal anything they didn't want to, and that includes lives 
- Mabel and Lysanderoth join the two in the caboose and also investigate the vessel 
	- Hymn casts Detect Magic and finds that it is a very ancient magic
- The train makes it to the station, but due to the conductor's weakness it goes out of control and careens into other trains
	- The crash causes the brain to fall out of the vessel and onto the ground 
	- Officers start rushing into the train and ordering people to evacuate 
	- Hymn touches the brain while trying to wrap it back up and hide it, and takes a massive amount of damage and has a vision of snake people torturing and mummifying each other
	- Oz touches the brain and takes some damage, is able to save against the visions 
	- Party hides the brain inside of Mabel's mushroom Bag of Holding

## Three Hour Layover

- Lysanderoth takes in all of the portraits and statues in the station and is able to recognize people such as Meowcifer, then sees a large picture of himself, [[NPC/Lily Hazelheart\|Lily Hazelheart]], and [[NPC/Jima\|Jima]]; and also sees that Jima has her own statue 
- A page boy speaks of Lily's war against the [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]], also says blight quarantines continue

	- The woman introduces herself as [[NPC/Susan Dandry\|Susan Dandry]] and says that he is her brother 
	- Mabel says that she is his lover, and that she's been searching for him and last saw him by a tree 
	- Susan says that he was married and had children, and that he would never do that to his family 
	- Hymn says that she saw the two of them sloppy kiss
	- Susan storms off saying that she will get to the bottom of this 
- Hymn casts Find Familiar to summon their imp and has it turn invisible so it can make the bag invisible and has it follow them with it
- Party enters the commissary office to renew their passports 
- Commissar asks if they have any powerful magical items or Bags of Holding
	- Oz hands over her Potion of Dragon's Majesty and says that she has this, but doesn't know what it does 
	- The commissar takes it, inspects it, then puts it in a box with Oz's name on it, puts it away, and asks if they have any other potions of that caliber 
	- Lysanderoth declares his cursed sword, but they don't mind because it's already noted on his passport
	- The party does not offer up anything else or give up their Bags of Holding
- The commissar says that they now just need to go past the Truesight and Detect Magic sensors
	- Lysanderoth does so easily 
	- Mabel decides to test them and casts Druidcraft on herself, then immediately sets off the sensors
	- She sees that there are short-range Truesight goggles on the commissars and runes that detects magic being used 
	- Oz says that she still wanted to sightsee and wasn't ready to board yet, but the commissar says that they might as well pass the scanners now because they're going to have to do it either way
- Oz throws up on the ground 
	- The commissar asks if she's ill, but she says that she was on the train that crashed, and that the driver must have been a drunk because it was a bumpy ride
	- Hymn says that they need to get her to a medic right away and pulls Oz away
	- Mabel and Lysanderoth follow after
		- Before they do, Mabel shows the commissar the poster of the Doorguard and asks if he has seen this man 
		- The commissar says that a woman just came in complaining that someone had kidnapped her brother fitting that exact description, and Mabel rushes away
- Party reconvenes just outside the station to discuss what to do about the sensors 
	- Hymn suggests that they have their imp fly over the station with the bag onto the top of the train 
- Party has two hours left before the train is to arrive and decide to actually sightsee 
	- Oz sits at a café table in the shade and works with her jeweler's kit 
	- Hymn buys [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] a fancy lollipop, who excitedly asks for all of the flavors, but [[NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] only wants some milk
		- Hymn keeps an eye out for some sort of jeweler or blacksmith
- Hymn, Mabel, Lysanderoth, Arthur, and Pill all enter the shop of a scribe mage 
	- Lysanderoth gets the prices of scrolls and tells Arthur that he can pick out two things that he wants within their budget 
- Arthur returns with a scroll of Aganazzar’s Scorcher and a singular page
	- The page is written in a more ancient form of Infernal that has depictions of demons being dissected and torturing each other 
- Hymn objects to Arthur having the page, says that it is probably cursed and could do terrible things to him; like how they lost their hand 
	- Arthur says that Hymn lost their hand because they were ignorant, but he wants to be smart like Lysanderoth so he can be powerful 
- Lysanderoth feels the pull of his evil sword and pushes forward with buying the scroll and the page
	- Frustrated, Hymn goes off to a corner of the store and steals an unknown scroll 
- Session ends as as a whistle rings out announcing the train's arrival
