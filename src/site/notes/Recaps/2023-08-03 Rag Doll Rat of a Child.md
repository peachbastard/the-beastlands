## What Happened? 
## Panic! At the Train Station

- An albino wood elf approaches and asks if the party is bound for the train to [[Places/Foghaven\|Foghaven]] 
	- Can't make eye contact with her
	- Has a deeply haunting voice that sounds pained and uncomfortable all the time
	- The elf is put off by Oz and tries to inspect her further
- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] is ornery and asks who's asking
-  The elf introduces herself as Juniper and says that she was looking for people to ride with because she's anxious
- News boy walks by: talks about food shortages and [[NPC/Lily Hazelheart\|Lily Hazelheart's]] efforts in the Grainlands 
- Party gets through security 
- Mabel tries to put up another missing poster of the [[NPC/Doorguard\|Doorguard]], but a commissar officer stops her and asks if she will come with him to answer some questions about the missing man 
	- Mabel takes the poster back down and crumples it up, and the commissar tells that he'll overlook her destroying evidence this time
- Hymn tells Mabel that there's other men out there for her, and theorizes that [[NPC/Susan Dandry\|Susan Dandry]] was actually the man's wife and not his sister 
	- Oz offers to use Sending to try to contact him again after she rests next, and Hymn calls her an enabler
	- Mabel says she'll still keep looking for her man, but will keep an open mind while they're in Foghaven 
- Party tries to board, but they hear yelling near the front of the train 
- Protestors for non-magic users rights have gathered in front of the train and started building barricades 
- Commissars try to settle the crowd down
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] finds one of the leaders and asks if they would disperse if the commissars were to all die, and they say yes 
- [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]]  makes a speech and draws upon his abusive past and gets the crowd's attention,  so much so that officers start attacking him
- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] tries to rile up the crowd
- Juniper starts screaming at the top of her lungs and trying to rile up the crowd and shake them to make them do something
- Hymn casts Levitate on Pill to get him away from the two commissars apprehending him
	- Oz casts Banishment on the two
- Mabel transforms into a bear and tries to intimidate the protestors into running away, but there are hundreds of them 
- A bomb goes off that kills many of the protestors and harms the party 
- Juniper hides in the smoke on top of the train and effortless takes out a weakened commissar officer
- Oz drops the Banishment and tries to cast Dominate Monster on the leader of the protestors, but he resists against it 
- Hymn tries to cast Major Image to create the visage of a growing infernal from the explosion, but a figure whose face is wrapped in brown rags (leaving only their glowing blue eyes exposed) Counterspells them
	- Hymn tries to remember if it's similar to the rags worn by the Sorcerer's Union assassin, but cannot
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] sneaks into the train and is able to ascertain how to release the brakes, but needs to get the furnace going 
- Hymn also gets into the train, levitates Pill inside, and summons a Fire Elemental in the furnace 
	- They put their hand over Oz's and push the lever to release the brakes
- The train starts taking off without Mabel and Lysanderoth 
	- As a bear, Mabel crashes through the windshield of the train, then reverts to her firbolg form 
	- Lysanderoth nimbly leaps into the train with Arthur in tow

## Butch Cassidy Shit
- Party considers the ramifications of stealing the train 
- Juniper summons a hoard of rats and ravens to herself
- [[NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] asks Juniper if she's from a commune of elves because he thought they were all dead 
	- She says that they are all dead, and that the rats are their family 
	- Arthur asks if that make her a god 
		- She says that it makes her a rat
- Oz asks Juniper if she has any water 
	- One of Juniper's rats brings her a tiny water bottle, which Oz chugs and asks if she has more 
	- Juniper says she only has holy water, and is not willing to part with it
- Oz asks Hymn for water 
	- Hymn notes that Oz is extra pale and sweating hard and asks if she put on a cursed ring too 
	- Oz dodges the questions, says it's because Hymn's too hot, then walks away
		- Hymn gets flustered, says that it's true, then also walks away

>[!redacted]


- Oz returns, tells Arthur to follow her in Abyssal,  and he follows 
- Juniper sends out a rat to follow, but Hymn decides against invisibly sending their imp since they know Oz can see it anyways 
- The rest of the party follows Oz into the room 
- Arthur says that the writing is in a muddle of abyssal and older etymology, the language at the root of all language
- Hymn opens one box to find a tiara in it and magical gold coins 
	- They cast Detect Magic and find that most of the boxes are magical 
	- They suggest putting the boxes directly in the Bag of Holding, but each weighs about 200 pounds 
- Hymn says that they can put the boxes in their Demiplane, but they need to take an hour nap first 
	- They emphasize that they are not to be woken up for any reason 
- As they say this, the party notices another train that is about a mile away from them, but catching up quickly 
- Oz goes to cast Earthquake between the trains, but Hymn Counterspells it and says that it could just be another passenger train, or a Sorcerer's Union train and they just kill everyone on it, or it could be the commissars and they try to talk their way out of it 
	- Oz says, "Whatever, Hymn. You do the talking," and walks away
- Session ends as the train gains on the party and they try to decide what to do next
