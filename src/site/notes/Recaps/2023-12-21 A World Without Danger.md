- Hymn sneaks to the window and takes a peek and sees a Foghaven citizen forcibly dragged by satyrs 
	- Hymn asks Oz if she knows anything about satyrs, and she says, "They're not friends with the junken, but they're not not friends. So I wouldn't be surprised if they're under the junken's payroll now"

## Breakfast of Champions
- Mabel wakes up early to try to make a vegetarian breakfast for everyone, but only finds fish and meat

- Mabel runs into a corner and casts Blight on it

- Oz says, "Get the fuck off him," casts Sacred Flame on the ooze, and it splatters 
- Sniff roughly cleans him up
	- Hymn asks for Oz's flask and has Pill swish the tequila in his mouth and spit it out, and some small black snakes come out

- Mabel eventually comes back to, but is feeling really sick and says that she had a really good dream about when she was younger

	- Oz is confused and asks Hymn if they have a brother 
	- Hymn explains that Janken is their twin brother, and she takes it in stride

	- Oz laughs and says, "No, I don't"
