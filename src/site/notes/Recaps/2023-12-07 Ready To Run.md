# What Happened? 

## Follow The Sun
- The god spurts out a black substance over the party and coats the ground. Living hands reach out of it, and eerie faces stare back out. The substance knocks Roy and [[NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] conscious, and nearly takes out Sniff
	- Arthur goes underneath and his chanting stops, and [[Lore/Goathead\|Goathead's]] smile returns
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] casts Cure Wounds on Roy, who then casts Mass Healing Word on the party and pulls Arthur out of the muck
- [[NPC/Captain Janken\|Janken]] yells for him to keep the boy chanting and get him closer
- Hymn asks who wants a blessing, turns Sniff and Mabel down, then casts Misty Step to appear next to Oz 
	- They ask her if she wants a new god and she says, "Can't be worst than the last one"
	- Hymn tells her to get on her knees, pretends to poke out her eyes, then puts their giant hand on her forehead and starts performing a ritual as they bleed on her 
- [[Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] dives under the black substance to find Arthur's book 
	- Arthur smiles at Sniff as he sinks beneath the dark waves
- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] casts Cone of Cold on the god and Janken to buy Hymn time 
	- This gets the god's attention and he stomps over to Mabel and opens his mouth and blasts her again with the black substance. She feels herself weighed down by the snakes in her body, but is able to evade 
	- He then stomps on Janken, who spits out blood 
- Oz is unable to act as the ritual is being performed on her 
- [[Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy Valentine]] casts Cure Wounds on Sniff, then drags Arthur a little closer to the god
- Hymn's wings glow brighter and brighter and the blood dripping off them forms a halo around Oz's head
	- Light begins to build, making them realize how dark the place is

>[!redacted]

- Sniff tries to bring Arthur closer to the god, but he's still not reading from the book and seems off since he was subsumed by the black substance 
	- Arthur seems upset and says that it reminds him of the necromancer's cave that he was rescued from 
	- Sniff tells him to keep reading the book so he doesn't have to go back to that place, or somewhere worse
- Mabel casts Tidal Wave from one of the portals that knocks the god prone, but Janken is able to dodge it
	- She then drinks a Potion of Giant's Size
- Long tentacles reach out from the portal Mabel summoned the water from and grip Sniff and Mabel tightly. The tentacles remind her of the ones from [[Places/Kinnsmouth\|Kinnsmouth]] 
- The god laughs and says, "Fools, you've stirred powers beyond that your comprehension. Machine gods created by the first gods"
	- Sniff and Mabel feel a cold voice that threatens to overwhelm them, but they wash it away with a pop 
- The party hears a voice in their head say "Give him to us"
	- From the portal, everyone hears the sound of deep bells that sound as if they are filtered by water ringing incredibly loud, breaking the eerie silence 
- The god makes its way to Hymn and Oz, and stomps on Roy along his way and knocks him back unconscious
- Oz is still totally bathed in Hymn's white light and can't see anyone but them. She smiles, laughs, and looks up at them and says, "Take care of yourself, asshole," touches their hand and casts Death Ward on them
	- Hymn says, "Thanks for all the Death Wards over the months, but I won't be needing them anymore"
	- Oz walks out of the light and says to Roy, "Wake up old man, goddamn" and a white light similar to Hymn's passes over him and brings him back up


## There's A Devil In Your Smile
>[!redacted]


>[!redacted]


- Hymn snaps their fingers and casts Bane on the god, but it resists 
	- They fly towards Janken and use a Healing Light on Sniff 
- Sniff apologizes to Arthur for maybe breaking his neck at one point and asks if he wants to read his book again. He says, "You scared me in those woods. Mabel, remember when we were walking through those woods before we met the witch and [[NPC/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] snapped that kid's neck. Was that you, Arthur?"
	- Arthur says, "It will be"
	- Mabel responds, "You know, you probably just snapped some random kid's neck. You don't have to repent with Arthur. You'll be okay, you're gonna get out of this"
- Arthur says "It won't be okay for Lysanderoth" and starts reading again 
-  Sniff feels anxious about the part of Lysanderoth's soul inside him, then shoots the tentacles. The tentacle retracts from Mabel and recoils from the radiant damage 
- Mabel tries to pull the tentacle off of Sniff and wrap it around the god, but she's unable to hold onto it long enough for it to attach to the god
- Mabel tells Hymn, "I know you're an angel or whatever now, but I have to take him down" and tries to hit Janken with her Paintbrush Staff
	- She asks him, "How did you even find us? We were hidden"
- Janken coughs and says, "Your father betrayed your mother. He didn't believe in her own cause. He knew it was evil. If you had any ethics in your whole body, you would as well"
- The tentacles search around for Mabel, but she's able to evade them
- The sound of the bells threatens to drive the party mad, then knocks Roy and Sniff out. The sound drives the god into a frenzy
- Between Arthur reading louder and louder from the book and the bells, the god seems more vulnerable than it has ever been 
- Oz points her finger like a gun at the god and hits it with two Eldritch Blasts. The attacks seem to do more damage than anything else has, and black sludge pours out of it like a fountain 
	- She then heals Roy, who coughs up black sludge 
- Roy casts Cure Wounds on Sniff and brings him back up

## I Will Never Look Back
- Hymn takes the final page from Janken and uses their Eyes of the Rune Keeper to read it. They recite. "What is dead may never die and with strange epox, even death may die. The dreamers call the sleepers"
- The god looks up and emits a beam of white light from his mouth, and the tentacles take hold of him and begin to drag him screaming into the portal. He says, "You fool! This is merely my avatar! I'll find you on whatever plane! Whatever reincarnation!"
- Hymn pulls out [[Inventory/Backbiter\|Backbiter]] and cuts a hole from the god's side and picks out a pink ball of energy
	- They hear a small, "Huh?" from the ball 
- Mabel is in immense pain as snakes pour out of her pores 
- Janken calls to Hymn as he spits out blood, "You must listen! Heed me! Time is limited. Especially you, firbolg, if you want to save your soul and body. As long as this portal is open, it is vulnerable to dreamers that are trying to return to the material plane. Now they're called like a bell to the darkness. They're trying to slip through here, now. We must now choose godhood"
- Hymn says, "I thought I already chose godhood"
	- Janken says, "You only have a sliver of godhood. The bomb has both exploded and hasn't. We must let the bomb explode to finish fueling our godhood. We can teleport everyone out of here through one of the portals. Foghaven is already doomed."
- Sniff asks Hymn if they even wanted to be a god, and says, "I thought you wanted to save all these people"
- Hymn asks if someone can hold Pill's soul, and Sniff offers to pass it over to Arthur since he seems good with souls
- Hymn says "At first I thought I didn't want to be a god, all my friends are down on earth", then they reshape [[NPC/Pill\|Pill's]] body, "Now I can do this!"
- Pill is excited and says "I think I can access my magic!"
- Janken says that they could save the Material Plane
- Hymn asks if they can still save Foghaven and decline godhood, and Sniff agrees
- Janken says that they can, and the people won't be infected, but they'll still be zealots. He says instead they could be the bastions that protect the Material Plane from the gods that are trying to surface 
- Hymn calls for a vote to see if they should set the bomb off and become a god.  Janken, Arthur, and Pill raise their hands 
	- Hymn asks Oz what she thinks, and she asks "What do you want to do?" 
	- Hymn says they're a democratic god
- Sniff is excited at the prospect of killing gods instead of monsters
- Hymn says they've learned from their time on the streets that they're never alone as long as they have their friends and they don't trust the cosmic power 
- The black sludge begins to grow and grow 
- Hymn says, "Janken, no one deserves godhood. I was willing to become a god to save everyone, but if everyone can be saved without me becoming a god, I don't want it"
- Mabel yells for them to go 
- Janken says he won't have the power to save the world without godhood 
- Mabel grabs everyone's hands through her pain, and the party decides to save Foghaven 
- Hymn slams their sword into the ground and uses their power to save Foghaven 
- A rift opens up in the ground and depicts Foghaven in a rare sunny day with people walking around normally 
	- Sniff's portal senses activates and he gets the feeling that it's a good portal, then walks in
- Hymn reaches out for Janken, who reaches, then puts his hand on the sword and pushes them and tries to grab them, but they're able to pull away

## Escape From the City
- Hymn falls from the portal last and falls on top of the rest of the party 
	- They see [[NPC/Shook\|Shook]] and slap her as hard as they can 
- Mabel and Roy are still both quite sick
- Hymn says, "Mabel, we have to kill you. I'm sorry. Those black worms cannot exist in this world" as Roy continues to vomit black sludge 
- Hymn begins to cast Power Word Kill, but Mabel talks them down 
	- Hymn says they should get a drink
- Sniff says that the party can call him Bjorn now that they've killed a god together
- Sniff ascertains that Mabel could die within minutes, then casts Protection From Evil and Good on her 
- Mabel says, "There's a place I know with holy waters. It's the holiest place I know, but it's in the fey and may take a more than minute to get to. Roy can teleport us there if I draw a good enough picture"
- Roy goes unconscious, and Hymn slaps him and casts Healing Light on him. He regains consciousness and spits out blood 
- Pill beams as this all happens
	- Hymn tells him that they reconstructed him and that he killed the god from within 
- Pill looks older and more handsome
- Hymn asks Pill how it felt when he was a soul hanging out in their hand, but he doesn't remember
- Pill says that he feels great and that the curse that his family put on him has been lifted
	- Hymn high-fives him, and a burst of fire comes out of 
- Pill says that the necromancers sealed a demon into him to bind his power 
- Hymn asks Pill if he has anyone to thank, and he says, "Yeah, thank you, Oz! For taking me on this adventure"
	- Hymn slaps him, and he demands that Oz give them a lashing
	- Oz says, "Don't thank me, Pill," pats him on the head, then walks away
- Mabel makes herself throw up, but she can't stop once she starts and passes out 
	- A commissar officer walks up to the party and asks what's going on and tells them to present their papers 
- The commissar officer demands 50 gold pieces each to give them a sticker or go to jail
	- Hymn gives them a diamond, then he says that it's payment for one. Hymn thinks about stealing the diamond back, then gives him the 50 gold 
- Hymn pays for Mabel, Sniff, and Pill; then asks Oz if they need to pay for her, only to find that she's she's not with the party 
- Session ends as the commissar officer takes the gold and the diamond and tells them to clean up Mabel's mess, but doesn't give them the sticker
