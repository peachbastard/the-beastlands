# What Happened? 
## Another Runner In The Night
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] turns into a dark, shadowy mist and teleports away from the creature's grasp, shoots four Eldritch Blasts at one of them, but only one hits 
- [[Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] loads his glass cannon and tells Pill to get out of the way 
	- Pill seems like he wants to get away, but doesn't know how to get away from the smothering tendrils 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] shoots a Eldritch Blasts at the box on top on the monster, but it's not enough damage to make it explode 
- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] tries to get out of creature's grasp and is almost successful, but is too tired to escape and gets dragged closer
	- She then casts Faerie Fire, lighting up the creature with earthy colors
- One of the creatures crawls out from under the boxes and starts lashing out at Oz 
	- The other tries to envelop Pill
- Oz pulls out her sword, slashes the creature twice and slices off some of its tentacles, then turns into a shadowy mist again and teleports away 
- Sniff shoots the glass cannon and eviscerates one of them into pieces that slither back into the depths 
- A halo appears over Hymn's head and they cast Sacred Flame against one of them
	- They panic and a beam of light shines down on Roy 
- Mabel crawls in front of Roy and casts Produce Flame away from the two of them that severely hurts the remaining creature 
- [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] shoots a white beam of light that cuts a large section of the monster open, which releases Mabel and Roy and disorients the creature
- The creature stumbles towards Sniff and attacks him 
- Oz hits the creature with three Eldritch Blasts and it stumbles back, sprouting new legs to keep itself upright 
- Sniff jumps on top of a box and fires his bow at the creature and knocks it into a small crevice, in which it disappears 


## Two Tokens In Hand
- Mabel hypothesizes that the creatures came out of the portal 
- Hymn looks for a ladder to go down, but doesn't find one. They rappel down a rope and dig around the dirt, uncovering an object with a metal handle 
	- They then cast Thaumaturgy to shake up the dirt and cast Levitate to come back up 
	- They find a diamond dagger with a curve to it that's blueish-green 
	- They cast Detect Magic and don't find any magic, but was potentially forged with magic a long time ago
- Sniff goes down to see if he can find anything else 
	- He tries to use his mythical monster hunter sense to determine if there's anything off about the creatures, and finds that they don't seem of this plane 
	- He notes similarities to the creatures from the [[Lore/Goathead\|Goathead]] Incident, but distinct differences as well 
- Mabel also goes down and takes a deep breath to look for anything druidic 
	- She asks Sniff for help getting around, but is unsuccessful in finding anything


## Son, Don't You Understand?
- Oz walks up to Pill, ruffles his hair affectionately and says, "You did good, buddy. We're gonna have to practice that magic of yours some time"
	- Pill responds, "That's what I like about the Wizard's Union. Magic everywhere"
- Sniff grumbles about the rules and regulations of the Wizard's Union, and Pill asks what he has against them 
	- Sniff points out that he was arrested earlier, and Pill doesn't remember why, but says they the boys that bullied him there must have done something wrong 
- Hymn tells Oz that she's raising a bootlicker, and she responds, "I'm not raising this kid"
	- Pill says he's raising himself, and points out that he's taller than Hymn 
- Sniff shows the party a little human skull with slices on it in precise patterns 
	- Hymn puts the dagger in one of the slices to see if it fits. Results are inconclusive, but it's definitely blade-like 
- Hymn pulls out [[Inventory/Backbiter\|Backbiter]] and says, "Oz killed this child!"
	- Oz sarcastically responds, "You got me, I killed that child"
	- Pill shouts that she must have had a good reason, and that it's not illegal to kill children because they don't have citizenship or rights until they display magic 
- Hymn asks if they think that's good, and he says he does compares non-citizens to dogs
	-  Hymn calls him dumb, and Pill blasts them with magical energy and knocks them prone
- Hymn turns their back to Pill, who huffs and demands that they stop calling him names
	- Hymn calls him stupid, and he blasts them with magic again and knocks them unconscious
- Oz scolds Pill. She says, "Hymn's under my protection. Knock it off"
	- Pill protests and says, "You told me to stand up to anyone that bullies me!"
	- An angel appears and a burst of radiant damage that shakes the cave, and everyone is hit with radiant damage and blinded. Pill is knocked unconscious 
	- Hymn heals Pill 
- The party runs off, but before they do Oz asks Hymn if she can kiss them 
	- Pill says, "Oh, brother! Get a room, you two"
	- They say yes, and she kisses them and casts Death Ward
- Hymn trips as they run, and she and Mabel take on a level of Exhaustion 


## What Is It Good For?

	- Oz says they want her because Falconhein thinks they'd work well together 
	- They try to discern any lies from her and don't find any

	- They ask if they go up there and say they're going to give them Oz if they would stop, but Mabel says they won't stop

- Sniff says he's in favor of Foghaven being bombed, but does want to kill more junken

- Pill asks why they're talking to the enemey, and Sniff says, "It's called diplomacy"
- Hymn says they could take down the junken and establish a new political entity 
- Sniff, Hymn, and Mabel brainstorm ways they can get up to the airship 
	- Hymn can no longer cast True Polymorph to turn something into a flying creature 
	- They suggest that they cast Levitate on Oz so she can carry them up since she's the strongest 
- Oz says, "I'll ask one more time. Are we doing this?"
- Hymn asks if she has a way to get up there, or if she's suggest confirming the plan 
	- Oz pulls out her Sending Stone and says, "Okay, boss. Pick me up"
- General Falconhein responds and tells her to send her location and send smoke up to signal them 


## Into The River We'd Dive
- A smaller aircraft comes to their location and armored junken come out and ask Oz if the people with her are new hires for the cause 
	- She says, "Yeah, they're with me"
- Hymn ponders if the junken would take offense to them casting any sort of mundane magic, and decides that they would get some stern looks because of their grudge against the Wizard's Union and Hymn's relative newness 
	- Hymn starts humming and tapping their foot to put out feelers that they're a bard

	- He responds "Ah, so the prodigal soldier returns. As you can see, things have changed since you carried out the mission"
	- Oz asks, "So are we killing this emperor or what?"
	- He says that he's been named the interregnum imperator because of the emperor's failings 
	- He says it's a shame that the newest hire died, and Oz says, "He was weak and died accordingly"

	- Falconhein says that she's one of his most trusted soldiers and that he almost considers her family
- He grants her full enzine captain rank with all previous reward of the mission awarded to her and her family, but says that it comes with the responsibility of going back down there 
	- He asks if she remembers [[NPC/Lily Hazelheart\|Lily Hazelheart]], the one that she had captured previously, and she says, "You'll have to remind me. I've capture a lot of people"
	- He says that Lily's decided to side with the junken, and they've also launched a three-pronged attack against the Wizard's Union 
	- Another blast hits the Cause of War
- Hymn asks Falconhein if there's somewhere on the ship that they can take a rest 
- Falconhein expresses regret that he can't go down to battle with them, but says that unfortunately we gain responsibilities bigger than ourselves and we must put personal wants to the wayside 
- Mabel says, "'I'm dying, and I don't even know if this man can walk. There's no way you can send us back there without some treatment'"
- Hymn looks at Oz to see if they can discern anything behind her sullen and unchanging demeanor, but they can't make anything out 
- Sniff looks at Hymn and sees that they look confused and the bell on their tail is wagging slowly
