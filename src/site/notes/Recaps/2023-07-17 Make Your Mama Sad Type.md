## What Happened? 
## Lich Fight
- The [[NPC/Priest\|Priest's]] flesh peels away to reveal a skull made of jewels and weird flesh 
	- He returns the favor and hurls Hymn through Hell
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] tries to investigate the hand and feels something sharp like a splinter, but is too distracted by the pain from her lopped off hand to properly make anything out
- Mabel tries and fails to stun the priest with her [[Inventory/Paintbrush Staff\|Paintbrush Staff]] aimed towards vital organs
	- Mabel drives her staff down on his toe, then he resists her stun with a Legendary Resistance
- [[Inventory/Oz's Eye\|Oz's eye]] glows and she tries to Disintegrate him, but he uses another Legendary Resistance 
- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] dashes across the room, then needs a Wisdom save as his [[Inventory/Demon Slaying Sword\|sword]] pulsates the closer he gets to the lich. It feels like his ownership is being challenged by a more evil creature
	- He sees that the Priest does not have blood and muscle underneath, but bone and rot, and metal, thin chains of gold between the ribs and bones
	- The Priest laughs as he's restrained and looks with his jeweled eyes and asks if he thinks if it matters if he's restrained when he's unrestrained by life, and Lysanderoth is restrained by blood
- Summons another skeleton 
- Priest says to Lysanderoth, "Do you presume yourself some kind of hero with a sword like that? You'll have to prove yourself worth it if you don't want to lose it."
	-  Priest says to [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] after she tries to use her spores on him, "Do you see how life grows from even the lack of life? Your people were once trained in the way of real death. Would you fight against me, firbolg?" 
- Inhales Mabel's spores, then spits out a black cloud of flies at Mabel and Lysanderoth 
- Hymn reappears screaming and bleeding and yells, "Please stop cutting off your hands!" and a specter of [[Lore/The Hanged God\|the Hanged God]] appears and grants them temporary hitpoints 
- The Priest offers to make Hymn prince of the realms 
	- Hymn says they're already prince of every realm 
	- Priest says that people will be begging for hell after death. Says that it's a fate worse than oblivion, worse than hell
- Mabel summons a mushroom-y skeletal Chill Touch and attacks the Priest with it
- The Priest denies the party's accusations, says that none of the flock were forced to join, and they came beginning on their knees
	- He casts Crown of Madness on Lysanderoth
- Oz repeats, "Fucking do something!" and hits the Priest with a Sunbeam from her remaining hand

 >[!redacted]

- Lysanderoth's eyes, blade, and the iron crown on his head grow black and he attacks Mabel with a feral look on his face
- The Priest says, "Forsake this mission of violence. Do none of you care of the balance of the universe?"
	- Hymn and Oz say no 
- He points at Lysanderoth and uses Power Word: Kill, but then Hymn casts Counterspell and narrowly stops the spell 
- The Priest disappears and reappears next to Hymn 
	- Says he was going to make the death quick and merciful, calls them demon spawn 
	- He uses a Finger of Death at Hymn, but their Fiendish Resistance helps them resist it
	- He shoots another beam of necrotic damage that should knock Hymn unconscious, but that same feeling of invincibility and safety from when Oz touched them [[Recaps/2023-07-13 Heist Two Electric Boogaloo\|earlier]] washes over them again, and they come back to consciousness with Death Ward
- He talks about the hungry serpent eating death that we are feeding and protecting, and that it will betray us 
- Mabel's trauma from losing her family is triggered from seeing Hymn go down, and she dashes over to them as a dire wolf with a Potion of Supreme Healing 
- Priest asks if we have a thought in our heads because we just blunder through life and death, and have unleashed a dam of something we cannot comprehend 
- Oz asks the hand, "What do you want from me?"
	- Inside the eye she sees its a long sharp skinny piece of iron stuck in the hand about a foot longâ€”looks like a nail
- Oz pulls it out and feels the wrist with the hand that she cut off start to grow warm
- Priest asks, "Why bother wildshaping when you act like feckless animals no matter what shape you take?"
	- Lysanderoth asks what's in it for us if we listen to him, and Priest says it will save our soul from being forced through a needle and drank by a eldritch snake 
- The Priest is severely weakened after a second blast of Sunbeam from Oz 
	- She Disintegrates the Priest, leaving nothing behind
- Hymn sits crossed-legged on the ground, reveals the eye tattoos on each palm, holds them out, offers the nail to [[Lore/The Hanged God\|The Hanged God]], and asks if it's right and if the curse can be removed now 
		- Hymn tentatively pricks their finger on it 
	- The ring falls off the finger and writhes like a dying worm while shrieking; knocking everyone but Oz unconscious

>[!redacted]

- Everything becomes unstable and the church starts collapsing 
	- Oz drags Hymn out 
	- The structure becomes increasingly unstable as she goes back in for Mabel and Lysanderoth, and she hears the sound of laughter as she struggles for a moment over who to save while the ground becomes increasingly unstable
	- She narrowly pulls Mabel out, and takes in the church as it seems seconds from collapse 
	- Oz goes back in one last time for Lysanderoth and isn't quick enough to avoid taking damage from falling debris, but has a burst of strength and quickly pulls him out just as the building collapses into the river
