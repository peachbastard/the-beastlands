In this session, our adventuring party found themselves in a small town infested with fish-like creatures. Here is a recap of the events that took place:

The session began with [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] opening the door to the room, only to be met by a rush of fish-like townsfolk. A figure in a pointed hood stood among them, and a fight ensued. At first, the party seemed to have the upper hand, but they soon discovered that the creatures had the ability to regenerate.

Realizing the dire situation, the party made a daring escape by jumping out of the window and fleeing from the town. As they made their escape, Oz used her magic to cast Earthquake, causing chaos and destruction in the town.

However, the intense events took a toll on [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]], who suddenly experienced a nosebleed and started crying about the river calling to them. They mentioned that the presence from the cursed ring was embedded in their brain before eventually passing out.

The party took a short rest as they waited for the caravan to arrive. During this time, Hymn went off to pray to the Hanged God, seeking guidance on how to end the attunement of the cursed ring.

Once the caravan arrived, the party noticed a familiar faceâ€”the boy they had lent their donkey to. They also encountered an older man with a wagon full of corpses. The man explained that these corpses had been corrupted by the blight brought on by the Godsplague. He intended to take them to the church to be cleansed and buried as sacrifices for the gods, possibly creating a new god in the process.

Hymn shared with the party that they were told stealing a wand from a lich would be the key to removing the cursed ring. Oz recognized that the wand belonged to the most powerful lich known to exist, who was rumored to use it in conjunction with an eye and a hand.

Meanwhile, Pill, who had been badly damaged in the previous fight, required healing. [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] and [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] accompanied him to the temple in search of someone who could assist.

Oz and Hymn decided to stay behind and engage in some socializing at the tavern, particularly flirting with the bartender.

The session concluded with the party facing new challenges and mysteries, such as the lich, the cursed ring, and the significance of the wand. Their journey continues as they navigate the intricate web of danger and intrigue that lies ahead.
