# What Happened? 
## Heist 2 Preparations 
- Party has one chance tonight to get the wand before tomorrow afternoon when they have to go to the church's potluck, then catch their train in the early evening
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] goes to a local blacksmith and buys 1GP worth of scrap metal for making jewelry 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] asks who wants to steal a wand, and everyone raises their hand 
	- Mabel raises the firbolg's disembodied arm 
	- [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] says that he wants to help, but Oz says that tending to the bar is the most important job of them all
- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] uses the arm to cast Scrying in the cauldron so everyone can see
	- The [[NPC/Evil Firbolg\|Evil Firbolg]] fails and the party sees him wounded in a makeshift cot
	- People hover around him to do spellwork to regrow the arm, but with mechanical aspects 
	- Process looks painful and he's grimacing 
	- Surroundings look like dirt floor of a different cave 
		-  Everyone knows that the cave systems are very prolific in the Beastlands, and he could be anywhere
	- Sees the man with long blue tail and black duster seems to angrily rush up to the scry bulb, waves his hand, and stops it
- Mabel knows that it seems similar to the tech that [[NPC/Lily Hazelheart\|Lily Hazelheart]] was involved with
	- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] can tell it's nothing commonly used in the [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]], looks different in terms of material and uses smaller mechanical components 
- Oz casts Sending and asks [[NPC/Shook\|the bartender]] what's up with the firbolg from earlier and the firbolg village, and she responds:
	- "Known associates of [[NPC/Captain Janken\|Captain Janken]]'s [[Lore/D.E.D.\|D.E.D.]] group includes rogue firbolg, an extremely rare race.  Heard they were wiped out by Janken's years ago during war"
	- Party remembers that most of the few remaining firbolgs are very radicalized commissary agents
- Oz brings up genocide and says that when she's queen she should make sure that her people aren't fucking crazy bureaucrats, and Mabel asks if they're all gone 
	- Oz says they're not as long as you're here 
		- These words ("genocide", "when you're queen," "not as long as you're here") echo in Mabel's head 
- Lysanderoth goes out and sees a thick fog rolling in 
	- Hymn peeks their head out and casts Detect Magic. Fog isn't really magical, but does seem to be created with something that is magical
	- Their thoughts start racing as they try to pinpoint the kind of magic, and finds that it feels like a primordial part of the weave where all magic stems from 
- Oz lights up a cigarette, tries a Divine Intervention and says, "Do something."

 >[!redacted]
 
 - Oz groans, kills the cigarette in one drag, and says that [[Lore/Goathead\|the fucker]] didn't do anything, but that she does feel stronger
	- Hymn asks for a cigarette, tries to do the same exact power drag on their first ever cigarette, throws up, and says that they feel stronger too
	- Pill sees this as he comes over to ask for one of his own and hesitates
- Oz uses her jeweler's kit to break apart and crush one of the diamonds 
	- She then pulls off her leather jacket, unbuttons her shirt a bit, rubs diamond dust on herself, and casts Greater Restoration
- Oz asks Pill if he remembers anything that could help them, and he says that he was brought upstairs for healing with some other people
- Party decides on all going in, distracting the priest, and having Hymn cast Suggestion on one of the nuns to unlock the door 
	- Hymn asks how Oz will distract the Priest, and Oz lifts up her makeshift eyepatch to reveal the golden cat-like [[Inventory/Oz's Eye\|eye]] and says that she thinks she something they want 
	- The party decides to have Oz use Sending to warn Hymn if needed, but Oz warns them that it's her last Sending for the day
- As they leave, Oz gently punches Hymn on the spot where she had previously stabbed them, and a feeling of invincibility and safety courses through them for a brief moment



## Nun to be Found 
- Hymn turns into a half-elf with a notch on their ear to differentiate themselves 
	- The cursed ring stays on their finger when they change form
- Nuns are wearing white large billowy, almost princess cut dresses with white silk over their eyes. Pale despite being from different races, very gaunt
	- Hymn has to take a second to get used to walking around using the imp as their eyes 
	- They try to enter inconspicuously
- Mabel is an invisible giant spider on the ceiling and will turn visible and/or use her web on the rest of the party if Hymn needs help
- Hymn tries to see what the nuns are doing and goes upstairs while mimicking their motions
	- They mimic the nuns as they go through the books on the wall and finds that the text is empty
- Meanwhile, Oz asks the [[NPC/Priest\|Priest]] up at the pulpit if he has a moment to talk about his religion
- She asks what his god's name is, or what they're called and he says that god's name is not important
- Oz says that her friend Pill has been having dreams of a nail piercing through his hand, and that his eye burns 
	- Says that he has been dreaming that the nail piercing his hand burns like nothing he's ever felt before
- Priest says that he has a scroll for that in his study, then openly touches some stones that manifests a staircase leading downstairs
	- The entrance is covered in spiderwebs, and the Priest comments that they've been getting bigger and bigger 
		- Oz notes that statement, but doesn't discern anything suspect from it
	- He says that it's a cramped space that won't fit Lysanderoth and asks that he waits upstairs 
	- Oz follows him downstairs, then Hymn sends their imp after them
- Lysanderoth gestures for Hymn to go downstairs. 
	- Hymn tries to run after their imp, but the stairs close up just as they get there 
- Hymn goes back into their regular form, rests their head against Lysanderoth's shoulder and pretends to take a nap while they watch from their imp's eyes 


## Meanwhile

>[!redacted]


## There's lightning striking all over the world  
- Oz uses her last Sending to speak to Hymn and just says, "Run."
	- Hymn tries to send their imp onto Oz's shoulder, but the Priest shoots out a black beam that intercepts and incinerates it instantly
- Hymn calls the rest of the party to action, and Lysanderoth uses his Keen Mind to exactly replicate how the priest entered the sequence in the stone to summon the staircase
- The rest of the party rushes down a dusty hallway full of scrolls into an impossibly large room that is almost church-like. Things pulsate almost like alive they're alive. There are black onyx boxes in a small pavilion, and at end of room a massive hand with an eye in the palm
- The Priest opens his hand, and an onyx box opens and a skeletal mage comes out 
- He then shoots another black beam of energy at Oz
	- Oz takes the full damage and Hymn shouts, "Don't hurt Oz!" with Thaumaturgy 
- Oz yells, "I told you fuckers to run!"
	- Lysanderoth replies, "We did!" 
		- Hymn adds, "Towards you!"
- Hymn tries to summon an elemental, but is counterspelled 
- Mabel is still a giant spider on the ceiling and starts webbing the Priest and the skeleton
	- She gets the sense that the Priest has Truesight and can see where she is
- The skeleton starts speaking in a hoarse arcane language, lifts its finger, and shoots a black beam of energy at Hymn; who uses their Fiendish Resistance to resist it
- Lysanderoth makes short work of the skeleton, but the Priest lifts his hand up again and two more onyx boxes open; revealing two more skeletons
- Oz stabs the Priest with her dagger and casts Vampiric Touch
	- He laughs as it doesn't do much damage and says that he thought that the chosen of the eye would do better and asks what she would even do with the four items
		- Oz responds, "What you want. I will become a god."
- Hymn hurls the Priest through hell
- As Oz looks upon the giant hand, she feels her eye start burning
	- She then cuts off her hand, pushes the stump against the giant hand, and feels her eye burning almost impossibly hot 
- Session ends as the Priest returns with his flesh burnt and looking incredibly fucked up, shoots Eldritch Blasts at Hymn, then hurls the gravely injured tiefling through hell
