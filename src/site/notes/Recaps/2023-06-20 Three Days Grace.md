# What Happened? 

## Day 3 Morning

- Day begins with [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] asking [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] if she regrets killing what could have been one of her last remaining family members
	- Mabel says she did what she needed to in that moment 
- Pill reveals that he killed his whole family on accident, and he wasn't proud of it
	- He says that the SSP is a weird organization that all defers to one group, but it matters more which sect you report back to; with all ultimately reporting to Archmagis Meowcifer
- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] asks Pill if the Archmagis has been seen in public recently, but he seldom is seen. His votes still come through as reported in the papers. 
	- Lysanderoth tells Pill that he saw Meowcifer killed, must keep it secret
- Pill is optimistic that they have nothing to fear as magic-having citizens, not "no-magi's"
	- Hymn takes offense to that and says that people shouldn't be judged because of their magic, and should be judged on other things instead like their appearance 
		- Pill notes that one can change their appearance with magic
- Pill mentions that [[NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] has been growing quite quickly
- Lysanderoth picks up the baby, who calls him dada 
- They test the baby by saying hi to it in several different languages, and the baby is able to somehow comprehend it all 
- At Lysanderoth's request, Pill uses the meager cantrips that he can muster, then the baby copies him
	- Hymn gives him a motivational speech: says that the baby can learn new things so quickly because it isn't afraid of failing; whereas, Pill needs to just be like the baby and send it
- Mabel casts Detect Thoughts to read deep inside the baby's thoughts and hears it thinking in Abyssal 
	- She decides to put Pill to the test and tries to relay the Abyssal to him, but it's terrible and sounds racist 
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] walks in at this moment with a new black eye and recognizes the bad Abyssal, asks if they're teaching the baby swear words and says "fuck" to the baby in Abyssal 
	- Hymn turns their nose up as Oz approaches and pointedly ignores her 
	- Oz asks if they're mad at her, and they deny it 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] goes to talk to [[NPC/Shook\|the bartender]], and successfully flusters her with their flirting 


Party attends the morning sermon
- Oz makes a sarcastic joke about being excited to go to church, and Hymn laughs back sarcastically at her
- Hymn sees through their imp: purple fluid being piped up to a goblet
- Sermon: false ends in life and looking past them and true immortality that exists for all. To destroy anything completely is the greatest immorality, to treasure and to nurture is moral. To create, the most moral thing of all
- Oz sees undead in the crowd, priest is undead
- Priest talks about the wisdom of elders and that knowledge that comes with years cannot be easily bought 
- Mabel shows the priest the amulet, but he doesn't recognize it
	- He offers to take it so that he can conduct additional research on it, but Mabel offers to draw him a picture of it instead
- Hymn asks if another [[NPC/Captain Janken\|blue tiefling]] has some through this church, and he says that one did a couple weeks ago with some rough looking people 
	- He wasn't entirely polite to the congregation, made some startling accusations, and stormed out of town
	- The priest just shrugs when asked about what those accusations were, seeming nonplussed by the matter 
- Hymn uses their imp to invisibly steal a few drops of the church's sacramental liquid from behind the altar 
- Party returns to the tavern  
-  Mabel and Hymn identify the liquid as the same purple elixir that the river runner mage lich people were searching for
	- Hymn compares what they acquired against what the bottle they got in the previous town and finds that it's an exact match 


## Tattoo Time
- Mabel asks the bartender if she has any tattoos
- The crowd around them start to laugh and they say to never ask Shook about her tattoos
	- They have a running bet about what they're for, and the person that guesses right gets a sizeable pot of gold
- Mabel says that she wants to get a cover up done, and Shook says that she could always get something done by a local riverrunner, but Mabel wants something done well 
- Oz offers to give Mabel a tattoo, and she excitedly agrees
	- Pill asks Oz if she learned how to do tattoos in prison, but Oz dodges the question, then pulls out a prison tattoo-apparatus 
	- Per Mabel's request, she decently tattoos a mushroom with a crown on Mabel's sternum 
		- Mabel desires something that says that she is a strong leader 
		- She asks if Oz can do anything magical, and Oz tries to pray to her [[Lore/Goathead\|god]] to imbue some magical properties into the diamond ink, but nothing happens when she calls

- Oz hands the tattoo-apparatus over to Hymn and asks if they want to give her a tattoo 
	- Hymn says that they weren't mad at Oz, and asks if bartender really isn't her type 
		- Oz says she isn't 
	- Hymn asks if she's down to get a tramp stamp, and Oz agrees
		- Hymn tattoos a set of chains on Oz's lower back 
- Oz reveals that she can see Hymn's invisible imp, who flips her off from its perch in Hymn's horns 
- Mabel tries to scry on Captain Janken again, but is unsuccessful 
- Hymn suddenly panics and casts Darkness on the entirety of the interior of the bar, casting it in magical darkness, and tells Mabel that they're being scryed on
	- They then use Counterspell on the Scrying and laugh the darkness off as a funny joke
- Hymn asks the bartender if they're interested in hearing about the church's shady on-goings, but Lysanderoth sees that other people are listening in and stops the conversation 
- The bartender asks Hymn if she and Oz are close, and Hymn says they're work friends


## Day 3 Evening 
- Party debates their next steps: 
	- Hymn asks Mabel to make sure that Oz gets some sleep, but Oz protests and says that it's still early 
	- She suggests that she hangs out with Mabel while she brews her potions, but Mabel says that she should go to the sermon
- Before the sermon, the party decides to check out the town's general store 
	- On the walk there, Oz notably lags behind and Hymn keeps pace with her 
	- Oz makes a joke about taking in the view and not needing to stay behind with her, and Hymn says they're doing the same, and brings up the weather
- Store is helmed by an old, blind, bearded Drow man who offers standard general store fare 
	- Mabel is disappointed by the offerings, and says that she can poop out these Potions of Healing in her sleep
	- She also attempts to use Greater Restoration on the man to heal his blindness, but realizes that she doesn't have diamonds, and Hymn and Lysanderoth bat away her attempts at touching the man's eyes
- Mabel returns to the tavern in search of diamonds 
	- It turns out that someone had recently paid for their drinks with a diamond, which the bartender trades to Mabel for her potions
- Evening sermon: Night is not truly the lack of light 
- Not many of the congregation are undead, slightly high percentage are now than the noon service
- Oz pulls Lysanderoth aside and tells him about the [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]] people that attacked the tavern the night prior and asks that he take watch 
	- Lysanderoth asks if that's how she got the black eye, but Oz says it was from the bartender
- Lysanderoth enlists Hymn, and they decide to take turns taking watch
- Before they do, they contemplate putting [[Inventory/The Bomb\|the bomb]] in a different dimension because their attackers could be tracking them through the bomb
- Oz is asleep, and they ultimately decide against doing it without telling her first 
	- Mabel says that she'll be mad if they do it without asking her like how she was mad at the train, but Hymn says that she's only concerned about missing people 

People approach Lysanderoth as he's sitting imposingly on a bench
- Three people with huge spikey grey slugs coming out of their brains attack him all at once
- Situation looks dire as he calls for help and no one answers, then a tall [[NPC/Triangle-Hood Figure\|figure]] in a triangle hood approaches 
- The [[NPC/Priest\|priest]] appears and startles the attackers with his booming voice 

Meanwhile:
- As Hymn and Oz sleep, the door starts to slowly open 
	- Oz asks Hymn if they're close to the bartender like that, and Hymn blearily asks what's going on
- Session ends as fish-people from [[Places/Kinnsmouth\|Kinnsmouth]] rush into the room and are bombarded by the two's spells
