# What Happened?
## Better Bar
Party starts the session in a nicer tavern in the Wizard's Quarters called The Reflecting Teacup 
- Bartender is a sexy glass construct
- Ambient music playing by a bard telepathically controlling several instruments
- Medium-size, but warm 

## Foghaven Info 
- [[Places/Foghaven\|Foghaven]] is on several tributaries feeding out along archipelagos that feed into the huge ocean that covers the other hemisphere
- Most rivers begin in the Cyclopean Peaks, then flow through the Phase Hand to where no one can track down through the Riverlands
- Capitol of Foghaven used to be bustling, can kind of be seen in the decaying once grand architecture due to the position of the All Faith's Temple  
	- A centralization of unions of religions across the continent
- Many canals and large rivers, dockyards 
- Canals are full of river runners who use diverse magical means to propel boats from enchanted eels and sea beasts to self propelled crafts and sacred koi fish 
- Constant level of fog throughout the city 
- Party has seen a few groups of Wizard Union badge wearing patrollers clearing out fog as they go, but it always comes back
- Different forecasts of fog throughout different parts of the city
- Mayor is a vampire 

## The Menu
- Party settles at a table and the construct approaches 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] and Mabel are delighted by the fact that this place has a menu and take one to peruse over eating at the buffet 
- Hymn orders a round of drinks and sees that Oz looks impatient 
	- They cast Levitate on her and force her to fly around the bar like one of the giant koi fish
- Each cup is a beautiful individual glasswork
- Hymn gets really drunk really fast 
	- At one point they get on the floor and meow like a cat while looking for coins, but the bartender makes them stop
	- They also look around for a vampire, but are unsuccessful in finding one

>[!redacted]

- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] asks the bartender about the best libraries 
	- They are informed that there are no libraries, wizards jealously guard their books in large private collections 
- Hymn tries to remember if they've been here before 
	- They drunkenly tell a story about how they stole a ring when they were 9 and got chased by an angry man, tripped, fell, lost the ring, then got ran out of the city by the same man 

## Procession of Drow
- A large commotion draws everyone's attention 
- The mayor's parading drow on the way to the prisons through the street 
- Procession led by pale man with dark hair, long sword, scar on his jaw, leading a group of very beaten down, ragged-looking drow
	- Many of them seem to have strange medical conditions
- Everyone but Oz goes to the streets to watch, and are unsettled by the ongoings 
- Mabel turns into a shark and jumps into the water trying to find a koi fish and trying to get more information from the local fish
	- She learns that the dark waters have been spreading 
	- Mabel disappears into the water

>[!redacted]

- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] asks a local more about what's happening 
	- The local calls the drow "filthy white hairs" and says that they're getting "taken care of " by the courts 
- Party watches as the drow are taken down to the dungeons 
	- Hymn says they don't feel super great about what's happening with the drow
	- Pill is more flippant about their fates and asks Hymn if they've ever even met a drow before 
		- Hymn says that they've kissed more drow than he's ever met
- Crowd eventually disperses
- Party returns to the Reflecting Teacup without Mabel
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] is notably more content-looking than she's looked the last few days 
- Hymn gets even more drunk, asks Oz for a cigarette, and is frivolously given three
	- In their drunken stupor they try and fail at casting a Minor Illusion flame to light the cigarette and express concern that Mabel has been eaten by an eel
- A  woman in white gloves smoothly reaches over and lights Hymn's cigarette with a purple flame
- Hymn says they're the cutest tiefling she will find anywhere around 
	- They ask Oz if they should be suspicious, and the masked person says to always be suspicious, then disappears with a plume of birds
- Hymn tries to use Levitate to bring food from the buffet over to the party, but Lysanderoth intercepts and takes the leather loop they need to cast the spell
	- They complain to Oz, who tears a strip off her leather armor to make them a new loop 
	- They thank Oz and kiss her on the cheek
- Hymn chugs another drink and immediately passes out
- The party minus Mabel settle in for a long rest with Arthur and Pill in one room, Lysanderoth by himself, and Oz an Hymn in the deluxe room
- Mabel returns with a small bag of gold and a painting
	- She casts Scrying on the [[NPC/Evil Firbolg\|evil firbolg]] that hangs out with [[NPC/Captain Janken\|Captain Janken]] 
	- Finds him in layers of clothing in the fog walking beside a river 
		- The mustachioed blue tiefling pops in front of the scrying orb and it disappears 

## Do You Get Déjà Vu?
- Party sleeps in the most comfortable beds they've ever encountered, or at least have for a while, and are in a deep, but brief sleep 
- They are awakened by a crashing through the window of the deluxe room 
	- A slimy tentacle appendage grabs Hymn and whips them into the walls, but they are able to break free 
- Peasants that look fairly similar to the fishfolk of [[Places/Kinnsmouth\|Kinnsmouth]] enter Mabel and Lysanderoth's room 
- Lysanderoth runs through the fishfolk's attacks and checks on Arthur and Pill
	- He finds Pill asleep and Arthur standing over him saying, "They're here"
		- Arthur doesn't look up to acknowledge Lysanderoth as he agrees to watch over Pill 
- Oz fires a Guiding Bolt at one of the fishfolk in retaliation for getting stabbed by their serpentine blades
	- Gills start to open on her neck
- Mabel throws a net at two of the fishfolk in her room, runs across the tavern, then enters the deluxe room and starts punching the one that stabbed Oz
- Hymn's fingertips turn into points and stab into the tentacle as they cast Vampiric Touch, ripping it off, and gaining temporary hitpoints in the process
- Lysanderoth turns one of the peasants into a perforated mess 
	- Small almost fungal protrusions begin to grow out its corpse 
	- He starts pounding on the doors of the two other occupied rooms, but both occupants tell him to keep it down so they can sleep 
- The glass construct cowers behind the bar and tries to protect the glassware
	- Mabel tells them to call the guards, and they say that there was once a panic button that contacted the old constable, but there has been a change in the police, and they no longer have this option 
- Hymn hears the familiar voice of the entity that had previously haunted them through the ring and made them perpetually moist
- One of the surviving fishfolk with a metal mask on runs into the middle of the tavern and starts carving runes into itself as they all start chanting 
- Oz pulls off her makeshift eyepatch to reveal her [[Inventory/Oz's Eye\|golden eye]] and casts Disintegrate
- The spell completely destroys part of the creature, which then melts as all the peasants in the building seemingly exsanguinate at the same time and merge into one entity, that then seeps through the floorboards and out of the tavern 
- The party finally gets a long rest in

## Poetry Out Loud
- In the morning, Mabel tells the party about how she was a shark in the river and  talking to the fish  
	- They seem like they knew that there was change and "it" was supposed to be an eel
	- She found a friendly wizard who told her that the firbolg he knew of joined the commissars as fanatical assassins and enforcers dedicated rooting out Junken agents
-  Hymn is visibly hungover and pukes in their mouth a little 
	- Oz gently thumps them on the back and casts Lesser Restoration to cure their hangover 
- The bartender asks Oz if she'll have the usual, and Oz agrees 
- One of the only other people in the tavern at this time is a waifish pale elf with snake tattoos on her forearms drinking the same drink as Oz
	- Oz walks over, lifts up her drink at the elf, and says cheers 
	- She doesn't rebuke Oz's attention, but doesn't reciprocate it
		- Oz winks at her and walks back to the party
- Hymn decides to approach her and finds that she has very interesting eyes and is reading a book of poetry 
	- Through their flirting, they are able to learn that her name is Azara
	- They ask what her favorite poem is, and she says that she may perhaps slip a copy of it beneath their door 
- Lysanderoth approaches and pulls out the ancient artifacts he got from the Yuan-Ti temple and asks her if she recognizes them; which she declines 
	- He asks about her tattoos and insists that she must know more about these artifacts 
	- She responds that they are traditional tattoos to her family and culture, and asks that he leaves her alone
- Lysanderoth grumbles about the elf as he leaves, and Hymn is surprised to see that he has that kind of vitriol in him
- Lysanderoth asks Pill about his night, but he doesn't remember it 
	- Oz tries to jog his memory by yelling threats in Abyssal, but it doesn't help 
- Oz starts to get a message from her Sending Stone and walks out of the tavern with her drink to smoke a cigarette and take the call 
	- Hymn has their sprite hang onto her back and follow/listen in 

>[!redacted]

- Oz scritches the sprite, gives it some loose nuts and berries; then says, "Aight, boss," and ends the call
	- She walks back into the tavern after contemplating smashing her fancy glass and tells the party that she has some business she needs to attend to 
- Hymn gets excited and asks if they can come, but is reminded that they need to seek out books at the All Faiths Temple
