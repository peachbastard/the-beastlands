# What Happened?
## Train Spotting 
>[!redacted]

- Train with thick red smoke plumes, gaining but still a decent ways back 
	- The train slows with the Hallucinatory Terrain Mabel previously summoned, but continues forward
	- Train has no markings and has small slits where passenger windows normally would be 
- Party minus Oz plots to potentially fake their death
	- They come up with a plan to have Mabel drink one of her Potions of Dragon's Majesty, destroy the train they're in, make it look like they all died, then fly to [[Places/Foghaven\|Foghaven]] 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] says they can turn the train into a an adult brass dragon 
- [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] says they could pick up the train, bring the people to him, and kill them all  
- Train starts to gain speed and they hurriedly go with the plan to fake their deaths and fly off
	- Hymn turns to apologize to Oz, then remembers that she had walked away
>[!redacted]
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] is on top of the train smoking a cigarette when Hymn finds her
	- They apologize for Counterspelling her Earthquake spell, says they promise to make it up to her, and thank her for all the nice things she's done for them 
	- They says they appreciate her, but on that note they're going to turn into a dragon and fly away
	- Oz readily agrees to the plan and follows after them
- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] drinks the potion and turns into a dragon and everyone climbs into her mouth
	- Mabel starts to get hit by roped ballista 
- Lysanderoth grabs his crowbar, uses it to ride the rope down, then kills a firbolg inside that is wrapped in cloth with an interesting pair of googles on their head, the same used by the commissars 
	- He yells up to Mabel about the dead firbolg 
	- She can hear it with her keen dragon senses and is sad, but pragmatic about it 
- Oz attempts to follow with her own crowbar, but trips on one of Mabel's teeth and tumbles out of her mouth 
	- As she falls in she casts Death Ward on herself in mid-air
	- Oz smacks against the front of the train and sees three figures at the front of it, but no visible doors 
- Hymn decides to stay inside Mabel's mouth 
- Mabel uses a wing attack ability against the train in an attempt at knocking it over
	- She then picks up Lysanderoth and Oz 
	- As they fly off, a wave of Blight spells are fired at the party, but Mabel uses her three Legendary Resistances to succeed on all her saving throws 
		- A fourth Blight spell hits the party, which everyone but Oz have resistances against 
- Mabel uses her monk skills to get the party hundreds of feet away from the train; however, a spell hits Lysanderoth as they're flying away

## Shake It Out
- Lysanderoth unleashes three attacks against Hymn, which should kill them, but Oz's Death Ward from [[Recaps/2023-07-27 Happiness Hit Her#Brain Drain\|earlier that day]] activates 
	- Hymn asks him what the hell he's doing and retaliates with their Hellish Rebuke 

>[!redacted]

- Oz pulls out her dagger, seemingly swipes at nothing in the air near Lysanderoth's back, then casts Remove Curse
- The demon is painfully ripped from Lysanderoth and blood sprays all over as he takes a massive amount of slashing damage and his back is torn apart 
- Lysanderoth thanks Oz and feels much better now that he doesn't have a demon at his back constantly talking in his head and telling him to kill the party
	- He says that he now finds the bomb a bad idea 
- Hymn pukes blood
	- Oz casts Mass Heal on the party for more hitpoints than they actually have 
- The party contemplates their next move:
	- Lysanderoth uses the blood everywhere to write out calculations on whether or not they can get to Foghaven in an hour at their speed, and finds that they can 
- They then try to figure out how they're going to get into the city 
	- Mabel suggests that they stop near Foghaven and walk in
		- They're not sure if they're going to be able to just walk in after they stole a train 
- Oz proposes that they just fly over, drop the bomb, then leave 
- Hymn instantly becomes livid and says that they have the bomb,  that they don't care about them, and they're not going to kill all those people 
	- They put a finger to their forehead and threaten to use Finger of Death on themselves first so that they can never get the bomb
- Hymn asks who thinks that the bomb is a bad idea, and only they and Lysanderoth raise their hand
	- Oz says they'll give it a day then talk about it then 
- Oz asks Lysanderoth if he feels better now that he's no longer cursed, and he reaffirms that he does 


## Bloodthirst
- Mabel lands to where they're just out of sight of town on the southern end 
- Lysanderoth tells [[NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] that they can look for a library and get him more books 
	- Mabel is instantly onboard with this idea
- Lysanderoth looks around for some water to wash the blood off  
- Oz receives a message from [[NPC/General Falconhein\|General Falconhein]]

>[!redacted]

- Oz mentions that the contact's name is [[NPC/Yorick\|Yorick]], but looks perturbed 
	- Hymn tries to discern why, but is unsuccessful
	- Lysanderoth asks why they don't just ask her 
	- They try, but Oz dodges the question 
- Oz's expression suddenly changes to something happier than the party has seen before 
	- Hymn asks, and Oz says that she's excited to be in a big city because she hates small towns; which they agree with
- The [[Inventory/Demon Slaying Sword\|Demon Slaying Sword]] remains on the ground glowing with magical energy and pulsating
- Hymn tries to lift it up with Mage Hand, but it's too heavy 
	- They try to bribe Arthur with any book he wants for under 20 gold pieces,  but he says that he hates Hymn
	- He insists on any book and starts stomping on the ground
- Oz says they could just leave it there 
	- Hymn says that they can't let some yokel get their hands on it and become cursed
- The party discusses what to do
- Oz suddenly reaches for the sword 
	- Hymn and Lysanderoth both try to stop her 
- Hymn casts Levitate on Oz and lifts her up 20'
	- They ask her if she wants the sword for its power, but Oz says she just wants to get the fuck to Foghaven 
- Oz says that she will bear the curse for just a few hours, then use Remove Curse again 
	- Lysanderoth says that she probably won't be able to do so because of its corrosive influence
	- Oz insists that she will be able to remove it, but Hymn doesn't relent 
	- Arthur asks if he can have the sword, and Oz is in for the idea of someone holding the curse so that she could remove it from them 
	- Lysanderoth asks Oz if she can speak to [[Lore/Goathead\|Goathead]], but she says that he would probably tell her to take it 
- Hymn drops Levitate on Oz and casts it on the sword instead
- The sword suddenly grows pair of huge burly arms that reach out towards the party 
- As the head emerges, Mabel uses her [[Inventory/Paintbrush Staff\|Paintbrush Staff]] to hit it like a golf ball away from the party, but the exposed parts alone are too heavy to do so
- A demon emerges from the sword and demands that someone form a new pact with it, or that they give him Arthur's blood to drink
- Oz asks what he wants out of this pact
	- The demon says that it wants carnage and to sit upon its throne of blood, and calls her by name 
	- Oz asks how it knows her name, and the demon asks if she thought that she could just call out to the nothingness like she has been and expect that no one is listening 
- Hymn asks Mabel if she can help their persuasion skills
	- Mabel uses Enhance Ability to give Hymn advantage on Charisma checks 
- Hymn says that they will accept the pact and holds their hand out 
	- When the demon goes to give it to them, they successfully finesse it into the Bag of Devouring as the demon yells something in Abyssal 
>[!redacted]

- With the sword problem gone, Oz asks if they can go to town now

## High Steaks  
- As they continue on, they happen upon a small, crying, dirty-looking little girl 
	- They approach to ask what's wrong, and she says that her cow escaped
	- [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] is very blasé about his disregard for non-citizens like her
- Oz asks if she can just give her 20 GP for a new one 
	- The little girls says that she was supposed to sell it at the market, and Oz offers her 25 gold pieces; to which Hymn and Lysanderoth each offer some additional gold 
	- The little girls says that the cow's name is Dandelion and it's her best friend
- Mabel uses her firbolg ability to speak with animals to yell across the field to ask Dandelion what she wants, then relays to everyone that the cow wants to be free 
	- She then offers the little girl some high-grade Psilocybin Clan mushrooms that she can put in stews or sauté
	- The girl doesn't know what sautéing means, nor what oil is when Mabel tries to explain  
	- Hymn tells the girl that she can still visit the cow 
- Hymn tries to cheer the girl up by using Minor Illusion to conjure flowers in her hair 
	- The girl immediately starts panicking and yelling that she doesn't want her skeleton to be ripped out 
	- Hymn tries to diffuse the situation by making sparkles, but it only frightens her even further and she starts crying in a ball on the ground
	- They walk away, leaving behind their gold, and the party follows

## Entering Foghaven
- They approach, still unsure if they're able to just go through 
- [[NPC/Juniper\|Juniper]] approaches and wraps her arms around the party's shoulders as they walk 
	- She says that she was able to escape with the help of her rats and ravens, then met up with her people to get a better handle on the situation
	- She then informs the party while they're not in any danger of being immediately arrested at the gates, they have unfortunately found themselves in a larger conspiracy amongst the commissars 
	- She tells them that the "PUP" are trying to stop the commissary, and that Archmagis Meowcifer is up to something 
		- Lysanderoth asks Oz if she was the one to slit his throat, but she's unsure of the events of that day
	- Juniper then transforms into a swarm of rats and disappears 
- Hymn has their imp turn invisible and fly off into town with the two Bags of Holding 
	- They give it a treat and a scritch before it leaves
- The party approaches the gates and are told that they need to have their passports stamped in the next 24 hours or be arrested 
- Hymn asks the guard if he knows of any good taverns in town with good vibes and hot women 
	- The guard becomes irate and and says that he's not a tour guide 
	- Hymn asks if he knows of any tour guides in the area, and he tells them to get going 
- Hymn tries to cast Minor Illusion to make themselves glimmer, but the magic sensors go off 
	- The guard points to the "No Magic" sign and tells them that they now have to pay a 200 gold piece fine 
	- They ask if they can wave it away for a kiss, and the guard increases it to 300 gold pieces 
	- Hymn asks if it's a crime to be cute and the guard calls them a demon freak
- Lysanderoth begins to question what authority the guard has to charge these fines and asks for his badge number 
	- The guard does not provide it and says that he's not afraid of throwing some washout into prison 
	- Lysanderoth asks for a badge number again in a more intimidating manner that seems to spook the guard a little 
- Oz cuts in to say that it's not important, and that the guard's not important, and hands over the 300 gold pieces as more guards start to approach 
- The party hurries off 
	- Hymn thanks Oz and says that they'll pay her back 
	- Oz says that she can't keep doing stuff like that because she doesn't have 300 gold pieces for every time Hymn's too cute 

## Cut From the Team
- Hymn approaches the first person they find to ask where the cutest bar in the area is
	- The man doesn't know the meaning of the word cute, and points them to the Rusted Stool 
- Lysanderoth finds a public potable water facility and uses it to wash the blood off 
	- Oz positions herself under a spout and starts chugging water
	- Hymn touches their amulet and talks to [[Lore/The Hanged God\|The Hanged God]] and agrees to their next mark
- The party enters the Rusted Stool to find a glassy-eyed bartender and two children about nine-years old drinking beers at a table 
	- Mabel and Lysanderoth go to the bar, while Hymn and Oz approach the children 
- Hymn pulls a dagger out and starts stabbing it between their fingers and using Minor Illusion to make it look like they're going incredibly fast 
- One of the kids scoff and call Hymn a freaky blue demon 
	- Hymn becomes enraged and grabs the boy by the hair, bringing the knife to it, and says to apologize or they'll show him a what a freaky blue demon they can be 
	- The kid pulls a vial of acid out from his sleeve and throws it in Hymn's face 
	- Hymn retaliates and cuts his hair
- The party enters initiative against two small children 
	- One of them has already mostly gotten out, but Hymn levitates the closer one and hurls him into the other 
	- They then shake the kid for their belongings
	- The kids run off and Hymn takes what was dropped 
	- Oz and Hymn pound the children's forgotten beers
- The bartender doesn't seem to care about just transpired 
	- Oz orders another beer and is given some thick, chunky grog that she eagerly chugs down 
- A man walks in with two sailors and starts singing a song about evil entities that live within the river 
	- Oz pulls out her harmonica and harmonizes with him
		- The newcomers appear to appreciate this, but Hymn puts their head in their hands
- Lysanderoth approaches the man and asks him about the song and finds that there are some similarities between it and what the party has experienced 
- Hymn looks bored, and Oz gestures for them all to leave
	- The party leaves as the bartender tells the musician ("Al") to stop talking about things he shouldn't be, asks why the party has come in, started a ruckus, then started asking weird questions 
- The party continues on to look for a more enjoyable tavern 
- They find themselves in the Wizard's District, which is only open to full citizens 
- Session ends as the party enters a new tavern that is much upscale with its live music, the sexy glass construct bartender, and its overall ambience
