In this session, our brave party faced intense battles and made significant discoveries. Here is a recap of the events that transpired:

## Young Love

The session started with the party witnessing the doorguard [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] had attempted to seduce being further consumed by the tentacled shark-man monster. Despite their relentless attacks, the monster's wounds began healing, posing a significant challenge. [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]], unfortunately, failed a Wisdom save and became paralyzed.

[[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]], utilizing their powers, sent the monster to a brief moment in hell before it returned for more punishment. Eventually, the party managed to defeat the creature along with the remaining pirates who had arrived.

After the battle, the doorguard was released from the monster's clutches, and Mabel used her healing magic to stabilize the man with a kiss. However, to everyone's surprise, the supposedly cured doorguard stabbed Mabel and revealed that he was still possessed. He rambled about the tolling bells and bringing the elixir, prompting [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] to cast Remove Curse to try to free him.

Although the curse was lifted, the doorguard remained on the brink of death. Oz looted the pirates' corpses and found a message in a bottle, along with some gold. The message, from a Priest Emissary of the Leviathan, demanded the return of the Reliquary or face dire consequences. This information added to the party's growing concerns and revealed the urgency surrounding the bells tolling.

Mabel skillfully concealed the doorguard and Lysanderoth in the forest using her artistic skills, while the rest of the party took a short rest to recover. During this time, Mabel approached Oz and requested the 10 GP she had previously bet. In a surprising gesture, Oz handed her the full 70 GP from her loot.

## The Dungeon

The party proceeded into a dungeon and encountered a hole that Hymn believed could serve as a shortcut. Mabel used her ability to communicate with animals to speak to a millipede, who mentioned recent visitors in the area.

A discussion arose within the party regarding stealing, with Mabel expressing reservations due to her upbringing. Hymn separated from the group to seek guidance from the Hanged God on whether stealing from these individuals was justified. Presumably receiving a positive response, Hymn proceeded to steal the 70 GP from Mabel, questioning her loyalty to the Yuncan.

As the party ventured further, they encountered a locked door that Hymn couldn't open. Simultaneously, water began to rise around them. Suddenly, a massive construct made of scrapped ship parts attacked them, using cannons and brute force to overwhelm the party.

Mabel took charge and led the party down a narrow tunnel, which the ship construct couldn't follow. However, they found themselves facing another locked door. With quick thinking, Mabel cast Enlarge/Reduce on Hymn to squeeze through a crack and unlock the door from the other side. They developed the codeword "parmesan" for when Hymn was ready to return to their normal size.

Upon entering the next room, Hymn spotted a pirate captain with an eyepatch and a vessel filled with red liquid containing floating bones. While attempting to steal a key from the captain's desk, Hymn triggered a trap, alerting the captain who attacked them with a spell.

Mabel, having transformed into a snake, successfully grappled the captain, joining Hymn in the room. Oz, unfortunately, remained trapped on the other side. After some effort, Hymn managed to steal the key, allowing Oz to enter. However, she was struck by a burst of black magical energy from the captain, resulting in severe damage.

The captain, looking emaciated, stumbled toward the red requiem and was absorbed into it, leaving the party alone in the room. Hymn expressed concern over their injuries, prompting Oz to propose a plan. With Hymn's hesitant agreement, Oz stabbed them with a dagger, using her Circle of Morality feature to perform a supercharged healing on Hymn.

Upon regaining consciousness, Hymn found themselves confused but impressed by the healing process. Oz handed them the 70 GP she had looted earlier. Suddenly, a mysterious man appeared, offering the party power in exchange for one of their lives. Refusing the offer, the man took control of Hymn's body and shot Oz with Hymn's crossbow.

In a surprising turn of events, Oz approached Hymn, ripped out her golden eye, and handed it to them. Apologizing for the previous stabbings, Oz faced the mysterious man, volunteered herself, and subsequently met her demise.

The session concluded on a somber note, with the party facing the loss of their trusted companion, Oz, and the impending danger presented by the mysterious man. Their future now hangs in the balance as they grapple with the consequences of their choices and navigate the treacherous paths ahead.
