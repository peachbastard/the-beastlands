# What Happened? 

## Young Love
 - Party watches as the [[NPC/Doorguard\|Doorguard]] [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] had tried to seduce is further sucked into the tentacle shark-man monster, and the monster's wounds start to heal 
 - Party keeps bombarding it, but [[Party/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] fails a Wisdom save and becomes paralyzed 
 - [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] uses their powers to send the monster to hell for a moment, then it returns for the party's beatings and eventually succumbs to them 
 - Party kills the rest of the pirates that had shown up
 - The doorguard falls out of the man and [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] uses Spare the Dying to keep Hymn stable 
 - Mabel leans in and kisses the doorguard and casts Cure Wounds
	- Mabel is shocked when the doorguard stabs her in the stomach and is still possessed 
	- He starts yelling about the bells tolling, and how he'll bring the elixir
	- Oz says she has something for this, but they just have to make sure not to die and casts Remove Curse
- The curse is removed from the doorguard, but he still appears to be on death's door
- Oz loots the corpses of the pirates and finds a message in a bottle and 70 GP
	- Tosses the bottle to Hymn and a health potion to Mabel
- Mabel splits the health potion with the doorguard, and he asks if she's a mermaid
- Hymn reads the following message out loud:

>[!quote] 
>We expect you to return your side of the bargain unless you want to bring the wrath of the floating nation down on you. If you're desperate for Elixir, then get us what we want. Bring us the Reliquary or face the consequences. The bells are tolling. 
>--Priest Emissary of the Leviathan 

- Mabel uses her painting skills to hide the doorguard and Lysanderoth in the forest and the rest of the party takes a short rest 
- Mabel asks for the 10 GP from her earlier bet from Oz, and Oz gives her the full 70 GP bag

## The Dungeon

- Party enters the dungeon and comes across a hole in the ground that Hymn thinks could be a shortcut 
	- Mabel uses her Beast Speech to talk to the millipede, which does tell her of people that were recently in the area 
- The party discusses stealing, and Mabel is apprehensive because she was always told not to do that 
	- Hymn goes off to another room to pray to the Hanged God to ask if they should steal from these people 
	- Is presumably told yes because they steal the 70 GP from Mabel, then asks her if the [[Lore/Junken\|Junken]] could have done anything to prevent it
- Party finds a door, but Hymn is not able to open it so they try a different route as water starts rising on the ground 
- Something hits Mabel as she turns the corner 
	- A large construct made of scrapped ship parts attacks the party, launching cannons at them and slamming them to the ground as the water continues to rise through the tunnel 
- Mabel leads the party in getting out of the situation and running down a more narrow tunnel that the ship construct cannot get through, only to get to a locked door
	- Hymn tries to open it and is skilled enough to not trigger the magical alarm, but isn't able to open it
	- Mabel casts Enlarge/Reduce on the already short Hymn to get them through a crack in the door 
	- They develop the codeword "parmesan" for when Hymn is ready to go back to their regular size
- Hymn sneaks forward and sees a pirate captain with an eyepatch next to a vessel full of red liquid with bones floating in it 
	- They try to steal the key on the desk, but a levitating skull shoots lighting at them and alerts the captain, who shoots a spell at Hymn
- Mabel is also able to get through to the room by transforming into a snake and successfully grapples the captain 
- Oz is trapped on the other side with no way to get in
	- Hymn is eventually able to steal the key to let Oz in, who immediately gets hit by a burst of black magical energy from the captain, and sustains severe damage
- The captain hunches over emaciated looking afterward, but is able to get over to the red reliquary and is absorbed into it
- Party finds themselves alone in the room 
- Hymn points out how injured they are 
	- Oz asks if they trust her, and they hesitate but eventually say yes
- Oz stabs Hymn with a dagger, and their eyes fly back open 
	- They asks what she's doing, and Oz responds to just trust her, then stabs them again
	- Hymn blushes as they go unconscious
	- Oz uses her Circle of Morality feature to supercharge a healing on Hymn 
- Hymn comes back to consciousness and said that was hot, but they're confused 
	- Oz gives them the 70 GP 
- A strange man appears 
	- He offers the party power, but one of them must sacrifice themselves for his use
- The party doesn't want to take the deal, then he uses his magic and takes control of Hymn; using them to shoot Oz with their crossbow
- Oz steps towards Hymn, pulls out her golden eye, hands it to Hymn, then apologizes for stabbing them
- Session ends as Oz faces the strange man, says that she volunteers, then dies
