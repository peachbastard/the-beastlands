# What Happened? 
## That's Me In The Corner
- Party wakes up to sporadic explosions 
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] says they'd usually ask their god for help, but god is fake. They lament about how embarrassing it would be if Janken became a god, and that they should try to find their parents 
-  Outside the bar is empty besides some fresh debris 
- Hymn finds a cash register and tries to pry it open, but fails. They look into the back room and see a glowing seal on the tile 
	- Mabel asks if they mean a seal like one of the animals 
- [[Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] investigates the seal, but fails 
	- Hymn finds that it's a Glyph of Warding
- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] is Exhausted says that she's not feeling great and says they should go to the [[Places/All Faith's Temple\|All Faith's Temple]] 
	- She's permanently crying black ooze and craving tequila because it helps numb the pain
	- Hymn and Sniff says he looks like shit 
- Mabel says she could use the ring from a while back to talk to the guy that was flirting with her, and Hymn says that since he was a fey they might be able to get answers from him 
	- She protests because it kind of feels like she's calling up an ex 

## Cut To The Feeling
- Hymn still has two of the holy items and ponders if they would become a god again if they get the sword from the temple again
	- The sword has a black blade with a sharp hilt 
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] holds out her hand and a similar-looking sword that's thinner with a fancy guard appears. She snaps her fingers and it disappears 
	- Hymn asks when she got it, and she laughs and says it just happened
	- They ask where she got it from, and she says that it must have been from them
	- They snatch the sword from her hand and throw it, and Oz snaps her fingers and it reappears in her hand
- Hymn tells Oz to close her eye, hides it, then she snaps her fingers and it comes back 
	- They ask if she wants her [[Inventory/Oz's Eye\|eye]] back, and Oz answers ambiguously 
	- Hymn says they want to keep it for now in case it can help them become a god again, and Oz doesn't protest

## Dead Man Walking
- Two ways to the temple: 
	- One through the Squid Row Canals 
	- One through the old wharfs 
- Party decides to go through the wharfs 
- Mabel asks about the satyrs from last night, and says that she's never known them to form an army 
- Gleaming metal construct ship by the wharfs and important-looking official wearing hastily put on robes of Wizard Union symbols and colors 
- Oz suggests that one of them make themselves look like [[NPC/Lysanderoth\|Lysanderoth]] and they might find less trouble. Hymn casts Alter Self to do so 
- Party sneaks by, and the officials look more interested in the things they're moving around 
- Hymn summons their invisible imp and has it take a closer look at the cargo, but it's not able to make out anything new 
- Oz tells Hymn they can drop the Lysanderoth disguise now "cause it's kind of fucking weird," but they keep it on because they like walking around big and imposing
- [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] asks how long Oz has known Lysanderoth, and she says, "I don't know. A few months"
	- He asks how they met, and she says it was while making a delivery 
	- He asks if it was the bomb, and she asks what he's talking about and if he hit his head while she was busy 
	- He says that he may have, and she ruffles his hair and says, "Get your head in the game, buddy"

## Knocking On Heaven's Door
- Mabel casts Pass Without Trace on the party 
- Party enters sunken walkways of the first inner courtyard where the bell constructs walk around not paying attention to the party 
	- No knights or Paladins of the Weeping Lady or Nuns of Reverence that they saw last time 
- Mabel suggests that they find the water where the dragon was, and Hymn ponders if they should explore the area they didn't explore last time 
- Sniff senses a portal to the north 
	- Mabel pulls out a bag of bones, throws them in the air, casts Augury, asks if it's a good idea to go towards the portal, and gets Weal and Woe
- Mabel says she doesn't have Divination prepared, and Hymn says they're done with gods 
- Party goes through the long tunnel to another quiet part of the temple where they only hear the water 
	- Hymn sends their imp down to the water to see if there's anything weird about it, and it's clear and beautiful. The imp takes a sip and finds that it's delicious 
- Mabel casts Tidal Wave and has the water splash on her, but it doesn't make her feel any better
- Sniff says that the portal is moving and feels it below the party
- Hymn casts Levitate to bring themselves by one of the doors they haven't tried yet, but doesn't find that it's magical. They're able to unlock it with their thieves' tools and take a peek inside
	- They close the door and say that there's horrors beyond their comprehension behind it that might be useful, but Mabel is apprehensive 
	- They think there's a dead godly beast behind it 
- The party debates if they should go to the incomprehensible horrors or the portal 
	- Hymn asks Oz what her vote is, and she asks Pill what he thinks 
	- Pill says that he doesn't know what they're doing here, but he still feels juiced up on the god blood flowing through him, and he'll follow her anywhere 
	- Oz says they should go to the portal 
- Walking along magically, but sparsely-wet staircase downwards for 10 minutes, but it still continues
	- Nothing repeats and there appears to be an end 
- Mabel asks Sniff if people call him Sniff, or if he just calls himself that 
	- He says, "I told you, the women call me Sniff. My name is Bjorn, but I have aliases for every place I go to"
- Mabel looks for druidic markings and doesn't find any here, but does recall does she's seen them before in the temple 
	- As they continue to walk, Mabel throws a Produce Flame down and yells that it's endless 
- The party comes to a turn in the tunnel 
- After another 10 minutes, the party finds themselves in a larger room 
- Mabel casts another Produce Flame and Hymn casts Light to help her see 
	- Hymn asks if Oz can see in the dark, and she says that she can see just fine

## Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me
- Hymn tells Oz they'll give her her eye back in exchange for a kiss, then realize it's still in their head 
	- Oz says, "How about I give you that kiss now, and you give me eye back later?"
	- They kiss, and Hymn skips down the tunnel 
- Mabel looks pointedly at Sniff and stomps away
- Hymn opens a crate and finds various ores and dark-purple crystal materials 
	- They ask Mabel if she knows what it is, and she casts Detect Magic 
	- She finds that it's similar to a strange type of primordial magic that the group has encountered before; including the lich's sacrament 
	- Mabel puts some in her bag 
	- Hymn tries to find if there's any pieces that fit together, but they're all broken apart. They propose that it might be angel bones and take the rest and put it in their bag
- Hymn puts one of the crystals in their mouth and goes unconscious with a bright flash of radiant light
	- Mabel casts Healing Word and brings them back up with their mouth stained black 
- Mabel is fascinated and goes to stab Hymn to see what happens, and Oz tells her to fuck off 
	- Hymn makes a joke about everyone in the party getting to stab them once
- Hymn asks for healing, and Oz repeats their words about letting the party stab them once 
	- They stab themselves in the heart, but fail to knock themselves unconscious, so they do it again 
	- They fall into Oz's arms, who holds them and heals them 

## Sheep Go To Heaven
- Pill stabs Hymn again, who tries to use Mage Hand to wedgie him, but the magic dissipates 
	- Pill says that their behavior has been a problem 
- Hymn kicks a sack of powder down the pit, and the party hears a moan that is neither humanoid nor beast, but something altogether stranger 
	- Sniff moans back and checks his compass 
- Creatures begin to crawl out of the cracks of the crystalline ivory bone 
	- They have animalistic legs that are scaly, yet hinged like a goat's with hooves. Bodies are masses of black tentacles and eyes 
- Oz casts Sacred Flame on one of them, and the radiant damage is reflected back onto her, but she absorbs half the damage 
- Sniff shoots the creatures 
- Mabel can't see in the dark, turns into an giant owl, slashes one, then flies away 
- Hymn whips out their hand and a dark, inky tentacles appears to them and wraps around one of the creatures, but it appears to be resistant to the necrotic damage
	- The creature seems to heal from it 
- The party is forced to make a Wisdom saving throw
- One of the creatures lashes out with its many tentacles and hits [[Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy Valentine]] like a club of snakes, dissolving his armor and attempting to grab him

>[!redacted]

- Oz is also hit by one of the tentacles, but is unable to get out of the way in time and is Restrained 
- Oz pulls out her sword and manages to hit it once, then again with her dagger
- Sniff looks for mining equipment overhead and shoots with a fire arrow to drop a crate on one of the creatures; which splatters and the crate begins to glow 
- Mabel flies by and attacks the creature holding with her claws as a Stunning Strike, but it seems that it can't be stunned
- Hymn backs up and casts three Eldritch Blasts at one of the creatures 
- Session ends mid-battle
