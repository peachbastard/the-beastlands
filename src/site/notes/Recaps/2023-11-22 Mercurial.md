# What Happened? 
## Louder Now, Louder Now
>[!redacted]


- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] goes up to the glowing green skull and sticks their tongue out at it 
-  They place the artifacts on Oz's body, then cut their hand on the sword and stab Oz through the chest with the sword 
	- The blade begins to glow and the body begins to shake
- [[Party/Roy Valentine\|Roy Valentine]] tells [[NPC/Pill\|Pill]] to be a hero and save his friends
- The giant skeleton monstrosity attacks Mabel's satyrs 
- [[NPC/Captain Janken\|Captain Janken]] goes up the platform and says, "you fool! A horned one must not hold the power!" and throws an explosive at the skull
	- The skull's flames are briefly put out and it falls to the ground
- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] easily slips out of the giant skeleton, then runs between Hymn, Oz, and Janken 
	- She gets critically slammed by the giant skeleton as she does so
	- She then pulls out her Paintbrush Staff and tries to blind Janken
- Mabel barely succeeds in grappling Janken, then hurls him and herself off the platform
- [[Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] casts Misty Step then attacks the giant skeleton, the paladin, and the lich with the glass cannon
	- The paladin completely shields himself
- The blade is heating up in Hymn's hands and shaking. They drink a Healing Potion and maintain their grasp on the sword 
- Roy says to the skeleton monstrosity, "Give up while you can, you're boned" and casts Vicious Mockery
	- The skeleton seems slightly taken aback, but has resistance against the psychic damage
	- He gives Pill a Bardic Inspiration
- Janken says, "If I made one mistake, it was not finishing the job in the village. I'll see you and your tribe in hell"
	- Janken deals an immense amount of necrotic damage against Mabel and burns the spores from her body
	- Mabel loses concentration on spell summoning the satyrs 
- The giant skeleton is illuminated by the black glow of the sword and attacks Hymn 
	- The skull rises to the top of the giant skeleton and perches upon its shoulders and says to Hymn, "You're being played for a fool and you don't even know it. Join me and I'll at least be honest with you, unlike that thieving god of yours. He's the god of many things, I hear"
		- Hymn sticks their tongue out at it 
- Mabel takes on her Symbiotic Entity form and throws herself and Janken down another platform and tries to pin him to the ground 
	- She then tries to blind Janken again, but the attack is interrupted by s sudden pain in her wrist. She can see snakes moving under her skin, and one has come out of her arm and slithers on the ground
	- Mabel screams because she's afraid of snakes and blinds the restrained Janken
	- Mabel lets go of Janken and willingly takes an attack of opportunity to get away from the snakes and get up the ziggurat 
	- She feels something bite her lower leg, then feels the worst sting yet from a sword strike from behind 
- Janken says, "Tonight I finish what I started at my birth! Hymn, you've betrayed our people! You've betrayed the universe!"
- Sniff shoots the paladin with his arrows. The arrows slides in where his helmet covers his body, then gold-tinted blood splatters against the ziggurat, and the paladin falls 
	- Sniff checks the body for potions 
- The handle of the sword becomes very hot and it takes all of Hymn's effort and concentration to hold it in place, but they don't let go
	- Hymn points their tail at the giant skeleton and fires Eldritch Blasts at it 
- Roy says to Janken, "Your plan isn't going the way you thought it would. You're looking a little blue"
	- Janken fails the save and says, "You're really starting to get under my skin, guy"
- A wall of flames sprouts from Janken's fingertips, separating Roy, Shook, and Pill from the rest of the party and blasting Sniff back and unconscious
- Mabel and Hymn both must make Wisdom saves as the lich starts making reverberating noises
	- Hymn almost slumps over the blade while bones drip like water from the back of the skeleton monster
- Mabel reaches into her mushroom bag and drinks a Potion of Giant Size, then tries to jump on top of the giant skeleton to rip the lich's head off 
	- She is able to overpower the telekinetic spell that allows movement to the skull, then pushes it into the wall of fire 
		- It lets out a shriek of pain, and Mabel senses that she is going to take serious damage to the arm that was just regrown by Roy's Wish spell
- Roy gives Sniff a Potion of Healing, then gives Hymn his last Bardic Inspiration
- As the skull is being held in the fire, the rest of the body is paralyzed 
	- The skull screams and pushes itself and Mabel back up the ziggurat 
- Mabel says in Elvish, "If you're the protector you say you are, kill that blue tiefling." She switches to Common and says, "I still don't trust you, but I will trust you when you do what I say"
- Mabel turns to Hymn, but they're passed out over the sword
	- She says, "Hymn, get your ass up!" and casts Healing Word, but they stay unconscious clutching the sword
- Mabel says in Elvish, "Well, my family's long gone. Even if they were to come back, it's not going to be the same. I know you can't convince me, but you have to help my friend," and she looks at Oz
- Janken casts Power Word Kill on Roy, who dies falls instantly
- Sniff drinks a Potion of Healing and casts Ethereal Step to walk through the wall of fire

## Tubthumping 
- Hymn sees a break in the darkness, but they can still feel their strength fading as they support themselves on the blade. Just as they're about to slip on it, a hand grips their arm and steadies them as Oz opens her eyes
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] says, "Miss me?" and Hymn pukes on her. Oz casts Death Ward on them
	- Hymn tells Oz about how Pill is the vessel and that Lysanderoth is dead
- Oz asks Hymn what she told them the first time she stabbed them 
	- Oz asks Hymn if they want to become a god, and they say they don't know and return the question. Oz reiterates that she doesn't want to become a god, and that her goals are much more selfish
	- She then tells them to trust her and dashes past the skeleton monster
- Oz stabs Pill through the chest with the needle and the sword and a burst of rainbow light comes out of him. Pill's body is no more, and turns into a creature with several horns on its head and holding the sword 
	- It speaks in several voices at once to Hymn, Oz, Janken, and the skull
	- It walks through the wall of flame, breaking it apart and grabs the skull with one hand and takes a bite of it like an apple. The skull shouts one final warning, "Don't trust the horned one," before it is swallowed up
- Hymn says that they want to be a god, to which the new Pill says, "You can serve me as one of my priests. You can have a kingom. A palace."
	- Hymn doesn't want to be a priest and wants to be special. The god says, "You carried the sacred blood this far. You've severed with your fellow priest king Oz. Don't think that I won't be generous to you, Mabel and Sniff, for I am a benevolent god"
- [[NPC/Shook\|Shook]] suddenly screams "No, no! I've seen you in my nightmares!"
- Janken grabs [[NPC/Arthur\|Arthur]] under one arm and gets near the bomb. He places a hand on it and says, "Well I guess there was always Plan B" and begins manually activating something on the bomb. Pieces lock into place, and the pieces floating around it start spinning faster. It begins flashing red and blue 
- Mabel turns to Janken and tells her to let go of Arthur
- Janken says, "I'm afraid no one is making it out of this city alive. You've just given flesh to a mad god morphed by the serpent itself that I was seeking to defeat. So my only choice is to blow us to the lowest part of the Hells. There's no citizens left alive now"
	- "This city is sacrificing itself to in a ritual to awake the first people deep below us."
- Mabel charges Janken for her mother, who Janken says was the worst killer of them all and was going to kill civilization and reanimate it as her slaves
	- She pushes herself, Janken, and Arthur down the ziggurat 
- "You think you've beaten me? You think you have me cornered? You're going to spend eternity with this blasphemous traitor god"
- Janken casts Power Word Kill on Hymn, but they Counterspell it with the help of Roy's final Bardic Inspiration
- Sniff asks Janken if this god has anything to do with the old dwarven legends
- Oz says to the god, "You can't kill me in anyway that matters. I've brought you into this world twice, and I will take you out of this world twice as many times"
	- She tries to pull the nail out of its chest, but takes necrotic damage instead
	- She tries to reach Pill and hears his voice call out for her
- Hymn says "Tell me, oh Hanged God, my true god. Do you really worship the snakes below? Or do you banish them from whence they came?"
	- "The god responds, "It's not a question of banishment. One doesn't banish the sand from the beach. We only exist in the dream of a sleeping serpent in the center of the universe. We must appease them. I struggled for a long time against them like you, Janken. But there is only darkness. Then there is only me"
	- Hymn says, "But if we struggle against them. They've been swallowing towns. How are they the nice ones that we have to appease?"
	  - Janken responds, "Careful, Hymn. You must know your place now. There's a new world order"
	- Hymn says, "I'm starting to think that I'm the one that was supposed to be a god." 
		- Janken responds, "You are special, Hymn. That's why you still live."
- Hymn says, "I'm starting to think that we should blow this town up and get out of here. "

## I Commend My Spirit
- Hymn gives Janken a nod and says, "Mother, forgive me" and drinks the Potion of Giant's Might that they stole from Mabel 
	- They rip the nail out of its chest and try to take the eye out as well, but an electrical current runs through them
- Janken hoists a huge junken-made rocket launcher over his shoulder that leaves a giant hole in the creature's shoulder
- Oz says that she will serve as the god's priest king if he lets the rest of the party go
	- The god laughs and says, "Oh, Oz, you look so stupid. Just like when your friends betrayed you."
	- She responds, "Yeah, they sent me to prison. What of it?"
- Mabel as a dragon tries to wrench the sword out of the god's hand and gets it halfway out
- With Oz's help, Hymn wrests the sword from the god's grip
- Oz tells Hymn to give her the artifacts because she's faster, but Hymn says they're done doing favors for her 
	- Oz says that she's not in the business of asking for favors
- Sniff looks for Arthur, who has been walking around and gathering things from the floor the whole time 
	- Sniff tells Arthur to come join them where it's safe, but the boy declines and retreats underground
- Janken shouts, "Quickly! You must choose a new vessel. Get clear of this creature" and blasts it with the rocket launcher again. This time it warps his face, and there's an evil eye and darkness under the skin like onyx or black, rotten blood
- Mabel's able to persevere as snakes writhe under her skull and under her eyelids 
- Oz tells Hymn to be fast while she creates a distraction for them, then casts Earthquake
- Hymn gouges their eye out and puts [[Inventory/Oz's Eye\|Oz's Eye]] in its place, then stabs themselves with the sword and the nail
- Session ends as the bomb explodes and everyone floats in a strange sense of timelessness
