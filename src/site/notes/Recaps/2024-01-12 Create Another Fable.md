# What Happened? 
## Something I Might Like
 
- The chain that was previously found is quite heavy, weighs about 60 pounds
- [[Party/Hymn\|Hymn]] casts Detect Magic and finds that it may have once been magical, but is no longer
- Hymn asks Sniff if he's getting any portal vibes, and the party's still in the area where he's getting some portal vibes 
- Party leaves the room, but Hymn hangs back to see if it's still empty
- Nev reads Hymn's surface thoughts and finds that they're thinking about the gross smell of the room that must have been from when the abomination farted, dragonflies flying around that remind them of dragonflies they had seen prior, thinks, "Wow, Oz looks great today", and thinks about pickpocketing Nev and whether or not satyrs hide their gold in their fur
- [[Party/Sniff\|Sniff]] doesn't sense any extra portal vibes from the one place they haven't checked, shrugs, and says they might as well check it out 
- Nev doesn't detect any magic as she walks across the courtyard, but does detect magic on Adelaide's claymore 
- The party enters a worn room glittering with piles of gold highlighted by sunbeams coming through from the stained glass at the end of the hall 
	- Hymn starts filling their pockets with gold, and Sniff's neck snaps around and he tells them that there's cursed gold in this region 
	- Hymn bites down on a gold piece and find that it's soft like gold
- [[Party/Oz\|Oz]] says, "Hymn, I told you if you need me to pay for your shit, I'll pay for it"
	- Hymn insists that she takes a bite, and her fangs extend and she takes a bite 
	- The party also finds, strange object artifacts, fabrics, books, crystalized plants 
- Hymn's Detect Magic senses that there's a magical key, a magical book which seems to contain some slightly eldritch knowledge, and a large portion of the gold is magic has alteration magic on it, but not all the gold, and buried under the pile are two or three more additional items
- Oz looks at plants: they're a black and purplish bloom that are held in stasis within a similarly-colored crystal that seems to be dyed by the flower
	- She casts Sending and describes it the plants to Mabel and asks if she knows anything about
	- [[Party/Mabel\|Mabel]] says she's that's a rare extinct treasure from fey legends and nightmares 
- Hymn puts as much of the jewelry on their body as possible while Nev helps them dig 
- In the center of the room is a dark, magical polished orb the size of a pomegranate on a simple brass stand
- There are also several chests at the back that Hymn checks for traps 
- [[NPC/Adelaide\|Adelaide]] seems unimpressed and waits hunched over on the handle of her large sword 

## All That Glitters
- As Hymn checks for traps, the chests and animated piles of gold come alive and start attacking the party 
- Oz shoots four Eldritch Blasts at the mimic, but only two hit 
- Sniff shoots the chests with his bow
- The three piles of gold crash over Oz and Sniff, but two miss, and one manages to hit the two  
- Hymn casts Summon Elemental to conjure a water elemental between the two of the mimics, and it manages to damage the two and restrain one of the mimics
- Nev ruffles through her bag and pulls out a bottle of holy water and casts Bless on the party 
	- She hovers in the air like a genie 10' in the air 
- The mimics start attack the water Elemental and Hymn 
	- One of their tongues stick to their ankle and grapples them 
- Oz blasts the mimic grappling Hymn with three Eldritch Blasts and it explodes 
- Sniff casts Misty Step to get closer to Adelaide and asks her why she's not helping 
	- Adelaide looks bored and asks if he wants help, and he responds, "I guess"
- Adelaide lazily approaches one of the gold hoards, her sword moving so fast it can barely be seen, then reduces it to almost half its size with three attacks 
- One of the gold hoards attacks Nev, who attempts a Silvery Barbs, but it still manages to hit 
- The other gold hoard tries to attack Sniff, but misses
- Hymn looks at Oz, then fires Eldritch Blasts at the mimics, killing one of them 
	- The water elemental attacks another mimic and kills it, then passes through Oz and gets her sopping wet 
- Nev talks shit about Adelaide technique to Hymn, then casts Vicious Mockery on one of the gold hoards 
- One of the mimics attacks the water elemental and Hymn 
- Oz fires four Eldritch Blasts at one of the mimic, but they all go wide. She then darts forward and stabs it with her dagger 
	- It squeals as it's stabbed and bleeds black-ochre blood. Stabbing it feels like stabbing into flesh 
- Sniff dispatches another mimic with his bow
- Adelaide executes one of the gold hoards, then cuts another one in half
	- Nev makes a jab about her dropping her elbow again
- One of the gold hoards almost critically hits Nev, and she uses another Silvery Barbs, but is still hit 
- Hymn casts Sacred Flame on one of the gold hoards, the light blinding as it glitters off the gold 
	- Their water elemental tries to whelm the gold hoard 
- Nev hits the gold hoard with Eldritch Blasts, one of which also causes lightning damage
- Oz hits a gold hoard with three Eldritch Blasts, then moves closer to the back of the room 
- Sniff crouches behind a pile of gold then fires two arrows into a gold hoard 
- Adelaide steps on the remains of the gold she's fighting and asks if the party needs anymore help on the last one 
	- She goes back to leaning on her sword and doesn't act
	- Sniff says, "If you have time to lean, you have to clean"
	- She scoffs and says "You sound just like my uncle"
- Hymn hops on top of their water elemental's head and has it attack the gold 
	- As they surf on top of its head, they cast Sacred Flame on the remaining gold hoard
- The gold is not able to hit anybody on its turn 
- Nev fires more Eldritch Blasts at the gold hoard and reduces it to a tiny puddle of gold scampering on the ground 
	- Hymn says not to kill it because they could keep it as a pet
- Oz critically hits the gold hoard with a Eldritch Blast and blasts it apart 
	- Hymn asks if she learned how to Eldritch Blast from watching them, and she responds "Yeah, I guess I did"

## The Gloom On The Grey
- Hymn has their water elemental pass over Adelaide for being a "sour puss"
- Nev reads Adelaide's surface thoughts and finds that she's very annoyed, but she's unable to read further 
- Sniff looks for hidden doors and doesn't find any, but does see that there's still a hallway that's free enough of debris to walk down 
- Hymn investigates the orb on the pedestal with help from Oz's Guidance spell 
	- There are no markings on the stone, it feels cold and smooth almost to the point of feeling wet 
	- Hymn picks up the orb and must make a Wisdom save, but nothing appears to happen 
- Nev tells Hymn, "If you're going to touch anything, you've got to ask permission" 
	- Hymn throws the orb at Nev, who catches it. They taunt her and ask if she had permission to touch it
	- She tries to determine if it's anything like what she's seen when she sang in a banquet hall or from her adventures with the satyrs
- Nev says it's just an orb, but it must be special 
- Sniff investigates it and finds that it's unlike anything he's ever seen in his dwarven education
- Nev gives the orb back to Hymn, who gives it to Oz because they're encumbered 
- Oz says, "Satyr, do you know anything about these flowers? It's supposed to be some fey nightmare shit"
	- Nev reiterates what Mabel had previously said and asks if they should keep it 
	- Oz says, "You're the fey. Won't your feylord like this shit?"
	- Nev briefly disappears into her ring and leaves the flower there 

## Don't Leave Me Waiting Here
- The hall continues on for a long time until they reach a staircase and three passage ways. Above each door is written a word in a different language 
	- Hymn recognizes an Infernal word for "god"
	- Sniff recognizes a Celestial word for "god"
- Hymn speculates that the last language may be Gnomish 
- Sniff tries to decern if any of the passageways has any particularly fresh air coming out of it and finds that it's the one in the middle that no one was able to translate 
	- His portal senses get stronger as they head down 
	- The script is beautiful and delicate like broken glass, but bold in certain points 
- Nev calls Adelaide Elvida, who says "It's Adelaide von Falconhein to you"
	- Nev responds "You're only here because daddy let you here," and Adelaide responds, "I'm here because I'm the best"
	- Nev insults her again and she retorts, "If you insult me again, I will get my satisfaction"
- Adelaide briefly studies the unknown word and says that it means "god" in the language of the First Ones 
- Adelaide says "You D.E.D. upstarts don't know generations of blood and turmoil. You couldn't do this by yourself. Everything is for the mission."
	- Hymn retorts that they could do it without her
	- She asks why they came back to the airship if they could do it by themselves, and Sniff says that Hymn's never seen an airship before 
	- Adelaide calls Hymn rustic, who replies that they're scrappy
- Hymn suggests splitting up, but the party disagrees 
	- They send their imp as far as they can down each hallway, but are unable to see anything of note
- Party goes down the middle hallway that's daunting long and ever downturned
- Oz looks around for anything suspicious, but the walls are bare besides some frescas 
	- Series of paintings of two identical vague-humanoid shapes standing atop pyramidical structures on top of the earth itself stretching into the black and stars of the night and also within the earth itself 
	- They're over as quickly as they began without revealing much information 
- Hymn says, "Adelaide, I know you're sour about having to work with us, but we're just trying to jest a little and lighten the mood"
	- They critically fail in their attempt at endearing the party to her
- The party walks for three hours. 
	- Around the first hour, Nev starts humming in a way that almost makes the party feel like they can't be frightened 

## Tried And True
- The party loses sense of time and come upon a small door that leads into a huge atrium full of incense where there's a huge figure stretched out on the floor with many smaller ones stretched around him 
- A heavily-ordained priest approaches the party and bows deeply and graciously and says, "We have been awaiting you for quite some time"
	- He continues, "Foretold because it has always been as it was and always shall be. What lays before you is a god of the ancient times. It can never truly die, but it will cease to exist unless you enter"
- Hymn asks if they must all enter, and the priest says yes 
	- He says, "It's foretold that you will all enter"
	- Hymn asks who it was foretold by, but the priest is too mysterious to get a read on 
- Hymn asks for his name and says that he is the Last Priest 
	- They asks for snacks and are told that they must enter the god with only what they've brought 
- The Last Priest says "We're neither down here as you are neither beneath the physical location of the temple. You've entered the god the moment you entered into this room"
- Sniff asks where the other doors would have led to 
	- "Like any door, it would have taken you where you need to go," and the priest starts to fade away
- Session ends as the party takes in the sights of the atrium
