## Number 47 said to Number 3
- Party approaches the building and decide to go in two different teams:
	- Lysanderoth and Mabel are Team Sigma and will approach the building from the front door because they don't rely on magic 
	- Roy and Hymn are Team Dragon and will approach the roof from above when Team Sigma is about 50' out 
- Roy doesn't believe that he will make a good dragon, but Lysanderoth assures him that he will 
	- Roy asks Hymn to tell his kids about this, and they say they will

- Roy takes off to another section of the roof, breaks through to where a well-dressed commissar takes him in with surprise

- Lysanderoth hits the man with his golden mace and tries to trap him with a fire rune, but the man resists it and says, "Storm lords of the seven splinter, you are a fraud and I will rip the language from your throat. My wrath is the mountain," then activates a cloud rune to force Lysanderoth to hit Mabel 
- Session ends as alarms blare and the party fights off commissar officers in their frantic search for their comrades
