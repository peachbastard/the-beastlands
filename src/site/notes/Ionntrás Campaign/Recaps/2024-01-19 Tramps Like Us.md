# What Happened? 

## Trading Traumas
- Story begins in the town of Ionntrás with population of several hundred, including small disbursed hamlets around town built on older remnants 
- Everyone in the party knows each other to varying degrees because there are only a few hundred people, and everyone in the party is fairly young
- The party:
	- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minski\|Captain Lamp Minski]]:  6'4, mess of black hair that is shaggy in a ponytail they put up a week ago, green eyes, two cat ears, and long cat tail. Born into the river runner trade. Matted fur 
	- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]]: a fisher that's only lightly-tanned despite years in the sun with shaggy blond hair, green eyes, green clothing with a dark orange bandana, and a slim, but muscular build
	- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]]: a stout halfling fellow with a red cloak. An aspiring adventurer that hasn't made it too far and has mostly made it through by hitchhiking 
	- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony\|Tony]]: a little boy when he has his disguise up, without it he looks like a ceramic doll with cracks in face and arms. An orphan urchin with shaggy brown hair, cargo pants with pockets and tools, and a blue poncho
- Reed frequently has dealings with Captain Minski; the two have had a number of drinks with the roughish gardener halfling, and are the only ones to take kindness with the strange doll child who seems to have no one else in town besides the three 
- The four are in a tavern in the merchant's district sitting around a table telling stories about the worst and best day of their childhoods
	- Whoever has the best best day and worst worst day gets whatever they want on the menu paid by everyone else
- Finn: when dad died and his uncle took him in
- Captain Minski: parents divorced and they learned at the cannery and cut their face in their distress, then had to keep working as they bled over the fish
	- Finn asks how it affected their schooling, and they ask what that is 
		- They say, "Oh you went to school and want to complain about one of your parents dying?"
		- Finn responds, "At least yours aren't dead," but Minski says they don't like their dad or stepmom 
- Minski asks Reed what her worst day was, and she says one day she almost caught a really big, really shiny fish, and fought for it with all her might, but it got away
- Tony says, "When my mortal body was taken by the fey, then my parents threw me out because they didn't want a doll child, but my parents are still alive" 
- Everyone agrees that Tony had the worst day, and Reed says "Mr. Tony, you must be a little more useful than a toy"
	-  Tony agrees and taps an object on the table and makes it glow 
- Minski asks if they can reattach Tony's limbs if they come off and if he bleeds, and he says that he cracks, but he can fix himself if it doesn't get too big 
- Tony asks what Finn can do, and he says he's a good gardener and a good cook 
	- Tony says he can't taste anything, any Minski says that he should've said that before they voted him for the worst worst day 
	- Minski says they should get the pick of the food since theirs was the second worst day
	- Tony says he would like a gun instead, and Minski says they'll get him a gun

## Eat You Alive
- An older man catching his breath yells out, "Some shark messed up the market place!" Most of the bar rushes out, and the party follows 
- Finn asks Captain Minski what race they are, and they say their mother was a beautiful human, and their father is a tabaxi 
- As they approach, they hear the guttural laughter the sharkin are known for. They weigh several hundred pounds and look like great white sharks 
	- They occupy a strange place in society: some of the few outlaws that have dealings with the floating nation pirates 
	- The town usually pays them the bribes they ask for on a personal basis to avoid any inconveniences or being ripped to shreds by several huge walking sharks 
- A crowd has gathered as three sharkin harass one of the shopkeepers at a stall
- Captain Minski and Reed know the shopkeeper generally, his name is Atticus Penn 
	- They lean over to Reed and say, "I owe these sharkin a few hundred gold, so let's try to stay out of their way at first"
	- She responds, "Of course, Captain Minski"
- The party creeps closer and they can hear them demanding something from Atticus 
- Finn hears them demand that Atticus hand over something that he took from the river or took from them, and threaten to rip him to shreds if he doesn't hand it over now. He relays this to the party 
- Reed says, "I can't just let them threaten this man" 
	- Captain Minski responds, "Yeah, me neither," hides in the crowd, and shoots an arrow at one of the sharkin 
- One of the sharkin asks who shot the arrow and accosts an old man 
	- Reed steps in and says that she did it. She says, "It's terribly impolite of you to disrupt this man's livelihood. I can work off his debt. I'm a hard worker"
	- The sharkin laugh and says that she doesn't have the "bees" to pay off his debt, and to give her all the gold she has 
	- Reed says she doesn't have any bees, but can catch them some fish 
		- She backtracks and says, "Oh... you're fish"
- The sharkin go into a feeding frenzy and knock Reed unconscious 
	- The red sharkin snarls with blood running down its mouth, "All right, who's next?"
- Atticus yells, "Alright, that's enough!" and explodes with wreaths of flame, causing the blue and white sharkin to writhe in pain 
- Finn looks for a way though the chaos to sneak through the crowd to hit the one that took out Reed, but he misses, then disappears back into the shadows  
- Tony closes the distance and tosses a vial of rotten mink to cast Tasha's Caustic Brew against the red sharkin, but it dodges 
	- Tony tries to cry to the red sharkin and says, "That was my sister!"
	- The sharkin bellows, "Good! You're next boy! I'll clean my teeth on your bones!"
- Captain Minski hisses and pulls out their two daggers and stabs the red sharkin, then Disengages to move back 
- The red sharkin says, "I'll get you for that! Right on, boys! Boys?" and turns to see the the white and blue sharkin are still writhing in agony 
- The blue sharkin is able to break from of his fiery shackles and tackles Atticus and begins viciously tearing into him; breaking the concentration on his spell 
	- The white sharkin remains motionless on the ground
- One of the sharkin attack Tony 
- Captain Minski shoots the red sharkin through one of its eyes, and it stumbles around in a daze 
- Finn lands a Sneak Attack against the red sharkin, and its massive bulk falls onto him and constrains him prone 
- Tony casts Cure Wounds on Reed, then tries and fails at pulling Finn out from under the red sharkin 

## A Fire Starting In My Heart
- The blue sharkin looks up, his mouth dripping with blood, looks at his downed companions, his eyes look angrier than what seems possible; then runs off 
	- Reed gives chase alone 
- Reed runs after the blue sharkin and tries to hit it with a spell, but misses and loses sight of the sharkin, and it's able to sink into the river and get away 
	- She says, "Mr. Sharkin, I don't know if you can hear me. There's nowhere you can run where I can't find you. And I will kill you"
	- The sound of laughter rings out from the water
	- She then makes her way back to town
- As Reed walks back, an elderly half-elf in a rocking chair says, "Girl, I wouldn't mess with those sharkin. It'll bring you nothing but trouble"
	- Reed says, "They've done my compatriot and a companion a great injustice. I will kill him. I will be great, or I will be nothing at all" 
	- The half-elf responds, "It appears that you will be nothing at all. That is, unless you accept one of my spells"
	- Reed says, "I don't have any money to offer you. I can catch you a fish. Fishes. Fish."

>[!redacted]


## Well, Sir, I Guess There's Just a Meanness In This World
- Meanwhile, Finn is able to get out from under the sharkin 
	- He goes to Atticus, who tells him to take the chest under the barrel and swear not to let them take what's under the chest 
	- The light fades out from Atticus' eyes
- Captain Minski is carving out teeth from the sharkin, while Tony rummages through the pockets of the dead halfling 
- Finn finds an almost unnoticeable key slot in the stone. He puts the keys in, finds a small metal chest or case that's rectangular, roughly half a foot by a foot, and is made of some kind of dark metal that's hard to see well. It gas handles on both its side 
- Captain Minski is on all fours eating the shark 
- Two town militia approach and ask if the party is okay 
	- Finn says, "You should see the other guys" and gestures towards the partially-eaten sharkin 
	- Reed says, "I apologize, sirs. We weren't able to save Mr. Penn. It was a failing on my part" 
- Upon hearing that one got away and said it'll be back, one of the militia says, "You fools. Don't come crying to Bluetusk when they come back," and leave
- The other "fort" Yuntrus in town is an ancient abandoned castle in many ancient myths and is said to be cursed, guarded, but full of treasures 
	- Fatalities and disappearances inside are enough toe steer most people away
- Nearby are the Artisan's Quarters, and town's famed herbalist, local farms and hamlets, and the Gallows' Speak Church that is old and still technically in use, though operated by a few silent nuns. It is unknown what gods the church worship, but they tend to the sick and needy 
- The market square begins to reassemble itself, and the militia take away the dead body of Atticus
- Finn tries to open the chest, but Minski stops them 
	- They get into an argument about whether or not Finn can teleport; with Finn asserting that he may be able to, but should save it for when its necessary
- Reed says, "Captain Minski, may I trouble you for a bite of that sharkin?" they toss some over
	-  Reed starts eating it then says, "To the tavern then?"

## Cause I'm More Than A Handful, You'll See
- Party returns to the tavern where there's a Drow bartender 
	- Reed hands over a gold coin and says, "Sir, please serve as much as you can to me and my friends"
	- The Drow hands over two dusty bottles of red wine. Captain Minski says, "Thank you" in Elvish, and the bartender responds in turn 
	- Reed rips the cork out of one of the bottles with her teeth and starts chugging it 
- Finn opens it to reveal a tightly sealed box with Byzantine mechanisms. Those that can read Elvish see Elvish writing, and that there's some kind of mechanism that is impossible to proceed through without knowing the correct passphrase 
	- Several messages spelled out in Elvish that seems almost chiseled or scratched into the metal itself that say, "Sealed. Keep out. Beware."
	- Another unknown language
- Tony tries to use his Tinkerer's Tools on the box
- Captain Minski and Finn recognize Thieves' Cant imprinted on the metal itself
	- It says, "Always runs, but never walks.  Often murmurs, but never talks. Has a bed, but never sleeps, has a mouth but never eats"
		- Minski determines that it's a river 
- Tony thinks it may be a clock, and Captain Minski asks what kind of clocks he's seen 
	- Minski asks Reed what she thinks they should do with the box, and she says, "The sharkin said Mr. Penn got it from the river. Maybe we should return it from whence it came and see what happens"
- The Drow puts two more bottles on the table and says, "More of the iceberry harvest. The berries came in good during the ice season this year. The cold gives them that crispy flavor. It reminds me of a kind of apricot we used to ferment in the dark"
	- The party asks the Drow about himself and he says, "I left the Underdark as a boy, after my father fell out of favor with his mistress and we had to flee"
		- Minski says, "Any woman that tells me what to do is a woman I like"
- Captain Minski asks the Drow for his name, and he says it is Dorian Hulkam
	- He offers to cook up the sharkin meat, and it's almost like lobster with a serving of mushrooms

>[!redacted]


- Reed's usually placid countenance is replaced by something more voracious, and she challenges the party to a drinking contest:
	- She beats Captain Minski, and narrowly beats Finn 
	- The party is apprehensive about whether Tony should drink, and Reed says, "If you're old enough to fight, you're old enough to drink," then outdrinks him as well
- Captain Minski asks if there's anywhere in the establishment they can puke, and Darien says, "It's alright. You can puke in the rubbish pile. It's a bartender's job to clean it up"
	- After Minski pukes, Darien invites them to lay on the couch near the fireplace
- Reed offhandedly compliments Tony for his abilities as a creepy doll boy 
	- Captain Minski yells that he isn't a creepy doll boy
	- Tony's head turns 180 degrees to look at Minski and asks them if they still think he's not a creepy doll boy
- Captain Minski rants about how much they hate their Gnomish stepmother, and how she's a skank that walks around in skanky clothing all day and distracts the workers at the cannery to the point where no work gets done 
	- They express a distaste for smaller races and Darien points to a sign that says "No discrimination allowed"
- Darien says, "The militia have been sitting on their arses since the last crusade came through"
	- Finn says they sat on their asses during the last attack, and that he was surprised they even showed up 
- Darien invites them to stay the night, and the party asks if there's somewhere secure that they can sleep, but he says that upstairs will be fine 
- Captain Minski falls as they try to get up the stairs 
	- Reed runs towards them and asks if they're alright, and Captain Minski belligerently insists that they're okay and says, "Don't touch me!"
	- Reed says she's not touching them and they say, "Don't even touch me with your eyes!" and she shuts her eyes 
	- Finn says that they're not okay and should get some rest
- Reed asks if she can open her eyes now, and Captain Minski gives the affirmative 
	- She then pulls a blue sword out and strikes Minski with it
	- Captain Minski yells, "You stabbed me!" and Reed responds, "No, it was more of a slashing motion"
	- Captain Minski angrily flicks some of their blood at her, then goes into one of the rooms 
- Darien says, "Alright, that's enough of that. What's with you fishing folk and being decades behind?"
	- Reed responds, "Fish don't change," and Darien says that he's been here for hundreds of years 
	- Reed excitedly asks about the fish from back then
- Darien says, "No one knows where the headwaters lay of these rivers, some of them cut deep. Strange things survive in that darkness. I've had a quite a bit enough excitement for the day after his last brawl" 
- Everyone goes to sleep upstairs while Reed sleeps on the couch by the fireplace

## Baby, I Got A Plan
- The quiet of the evening continues into the night as the party sleeps from the long, violent day

>[!redacted]


- Loud banging on the front door as Reed knocks on the doors upstairs and tells the party that it's time to wake up and leave because there's fish to catch
	- Captain Minski refuses to leave, and wants to stay back and fight because Darien is like a brother to them
- Darien says "After all these years of safety I've never become accustomed to it," and he draws a sword and magic begins glowing on his arm
- Party runs out the back window that Reed directs them to 
	- Tony almost falls, but Finn catches him 
- A visceral battles ensues inside as the party escapes 
- Captain Minski says, "I know some boats we can steal," and Finn asks why they'd need to steal one if they're a captain 
	- They respond "I'm a captain, they'd be grateful to have their boat stolen by the great Captain Minski"
- Finn discerns that Captain Minski is not a captain, and they've run ships, but don't officially own one of their own 
	- They begrudgingly admit that they've only ran ships owned by their father
- Captain Minski looks for a boat owner from their father and sees a larger double-boat which usually requires 2-3 people to man, and a smaller one-man river craft that would fit them all, but uncomfortably 
- 20 hulking sharkins approach with weapons made of anchors and cutlasses, some with cannons over their heads 
- Captain Minski ushers everyone onto the boat, shoves a rag into a bottle of oil, lights it, and hurls it in their general direction, but only manages to get one
	- A sharkin yells, "Oi, she torched Dave. I was going to torch Dave!"
- The river around these parts cuts sharply down the bank, and is much deeper than one may think, as is common for this area
	- Natural sails get going and the party catches some wind, but the common engine powered by technology or magic on these ships seems to not be turned on or functioning yet 
- Captain Minski says, "Ay, Tinker Boy! Come fix our engine" 
	- Tony apprehensively says, "I can go look at it..." 
	- Minski barks out, "You say 'ay ay, captain!' When I give you a command!" 
	- He yells, "Ay ay, captain!"
- A small devil in a cage looks up at Tony angrily and grunts, "What you want?"
	- Tony says, "I want you to go?"
	- The devil just looks at Tony
- Captain Minski says in Infernal, "Alright, devil! I'll strike you a deal"
	- It responds "What do you have to captain this ship?"
	- Minski says, "You make us go really fast where we want to go, and then I'll let you free."
	- The devil says. "A tempting proposition. Where is it you want to go?"
	- Minski responds, "Let's just get to the next town then. Devil, I was just kidding about letting you free. I just wanted to see a glimmer of hope in your eyes. Torturing small things is my second favorite thing to do"
- There's suddenly a huge crack and an explosion as a cannonball flies across the deck and skims Tony 
- Minski offers the devil a kiss and a bag of shark teeth 
	- The devil says, "What if you gave me 30 years of your natural lifespan?"
	- Minski ponders if tabaxi have 9 lives, and Reed says, "I'll give you 30 years of my life"
	- The devil says that her years are sour upon its tongue, and Reed takes offense to that and says, "I've lived a good life!" and Minski says that Reed is sweet 
	- Reed offers the devil 50 of her years, and Minski yells, "I make the deals here!" and offers the devil 15 years from each of the crew's lives
	- The devil says "15 years from each of their lives, and one of your eyes"
	- Minski offers the devil the crew's virginities and years, but Finn says he doesn't have his
- Reed says, "Captain Minski. Offer the devil one of my eyes and my years"
	- The devils pretends to ponder if for a moment, then says, "No"
- Minski continues to barter with the devil as the ship sustains attacks 
	- Tony pleads for Captain Minski to make the deal, then falls unconscious from another attack 
	- Finn stabilizes Tony
- Minski eventually manages to convince the devil to just take one of their eyes after being convinced by the sustained attacks and the fact that most captains wear eyepatches 
- Finn investigates the box and places it into the water 
	- In the refractions of the light, he can see markings that were hidden or invisible before with a Rubix Cube-esque mechanism in the front that requires a similar coding or pattern 
- Reed sees that it looks like someone wrote notes in Elvish, then crossed it out that gives her some ideas about how to work the inner mechanisms 
	- Her dexterous fingers, used to pulling the bones and guts of the spinefish and eels of the river, begin working the mechanisms of the cube that become apparent in the water, then the hatch opens and releases
	- There's a series of stone tablets with what appears to be a map
	- Captain Minski is able to recognize some of the rivers of the maps. Further written in Elvish, it speaks of great and terrible treasures 
- Session ends as the party continues towards the next town
