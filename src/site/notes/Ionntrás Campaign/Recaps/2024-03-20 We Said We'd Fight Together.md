# What Happened? 
## Letting Darkness Grow
 - A group of sharkin led by a huge great white sharkin captain barge into the sunken temple demanding revenge
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] is cut off as she goes to say something. The scar that's been growing on her face has become significantly worse, and she collapses to the ground 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf]] fires his sling and misses 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony Garp\|Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony Garp]] fires his sling and misses 
	- He then telekinetically shoves the closest sharkin 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] says to Captain Minksi, "I could have helped you, but I didn't. I'm sorry"
	- Reed then gets closer to the great white sharkin and hits it with a fire bolt
- One of the sharkins throws a spear at Reed and misses 
	- The sharkin then nearly hits Angelina 3, but Tony casts Silvery Barbs and causes it to miss; while also giving Reed advantage 
- Two sharkin hurl their harpoons at Reed, but she casts Shield and their attacks bounce off her shield 
- Finn rushes to the front with his new sword and his dagger 
- Tony yells "Nice hit, nice hit!" then casts Witch Bolt on the dagger wound through his Spyglass 
- Reed's sword glows gold as she casts Booming Blade
- The sharkin captain yells, "Oy, you louts! Come save your captain!" 
	- Two sharkin run up, and one bites down on Reed
	- The other bites Finn 
- A sharkin throws a harpoon at Tony attached to a rope and drags him toward the edge. Right before he's pulled off, something suddenly grabs the rope. 
- Still facedown, Captain Minksi grabs the rope and says, "I ain't dead yet!"
- The great white sharkin strikes down on Angelina 3 
- Finn rushes over and cuts the rope binding Tony, who is flung backward as the rope falls away
	- Finn looks into the angry black eyes of a sharkin as it reels in its rope and makes Finn its next target
	- Finn rushes a sharkin with his offhand dagger 
- Tony hides behind Captain Minksi, then casts Witch Bolt through his Spyglass at one of the sharkin cronies 
	- Tony then telekinetically pulls one of the sharkin into the water 
	- Angelina casts Shocking Grasp and misses on the great white 
- Reed casts Booming Blade on the sharkin captain, then uses an Action Surge to thrust upward; pushing the sharkin upward, then killing him as he's dragged down the blade by his own weight

## But Now I've Seen It Through
- Reed says to the remaining sharkins, "We're both down a captain. Leave now with your lives"
- The sharkin that was pulled in the water suddenly jets out wrapped in a hungry tentacle 
- One sharkin make a break for the nearest exit, but is crushed immediately 
- Reed returns for Captain Minksi's body, then says to the remaining sharkin, "Your crew's dead. Help us with this box if you want to live"
- Finn rifles through the sharkin captain's body and finds a strange compass with several needle pointing different directions and his huge anchor weapon
	- Finn offers the anchor to the sharkin
- The new sharkin says, "How are we getting out of here?" while looking straight at Reed 
	- Reed responds, "We're gonna run real fast and kill anything that gets in our way"
- Everyone makes it past the huge, rotting tentacles, but Reed is slowed carrying Captain Minksi's body, and feels one of the wrap around her feet 
	- Reed continues on undeterred with the body as she effortlessly pushes through 
- Reed introduces herself to the last sharkin, saying, "My name is Reed. My ma says it's awfully rude to ask someone their name without giving your first. Now that you have my name, what's yours?"
	- The sharkin responds, "I want to go by a new name. From now on, call me captain, no that's not right. Call me Bigtooth"
- The party takes the time to look through the box
	- There's a load of strange gold (2000) and fine jewelry, 8 black crystal spheres, a black candle, a falcon jar, and a stone tablet which appears to be similar to what the party followed here, but this contains strange info on it and no elvish handwriting
	- Gold glints strangely in the light. None of it's in coins—all in jewelry
	- Strange carvings on the tablet of 3 symbols:
		- Large, strange creature with the head of goat and its bottom-half made of snakes
		- Top: Strange, spiraling sun or star  
		- Mysterious glyph on the left that looks tentacle-like 
- Reed looks at the jewelry and find that it looks odd and impractical such as weird, tall tiaras 

## We Fall Into the River
- Reed takes Captain Minksi's eye and sword 
	- Finn says that Reed should take Minksi's coat and hat as well, but Reed shakes her head and says she can't take it, and it should go with the captain 
- Reed says to Tony and says, "Not this one. You'll get bodies to work on, but not this one"
- Reed covers Captain Minksi's body with oil, sets it on a raft she crafted, then casts Fire Bolt on it 
	- As Minksi's body burns, Reed says, "You'll see the future through my eye, captain"
- Reed goes to the devil and says, "Well. Things have changed"
	- The devil says, "They really haven't though. I told you that you'd make a great captain"
	- Reed says, "I know. But this isn't the way I thought it would happen. I never thought it would be like this,"
	- The devil says, "It never is"
- Reed and the devil come to an agreement, and the devil allows Reed to take over as captain

## Just What Humans Do
- Party returns to Dr. Barber to follow up on getting Tony a new body
	- Dr. Barber asks Tony, "Why go back to this terrible body when you can be perfect?" and Tony says that he wants to be a real human, then consents to having the procedure done 
- Dr. Barber shouts, "Behold! "and reveals a large, perfect, muscular body with rippling abs and artist's fingers and curly blond hair floating in the water
- Tony asks Dr. Barber, "Can I go back?"
	- Dr. Barber responds, "You won't want to. I put extra tendons to make your fingers stronger"
- Tony says he's going to eat and drink everything
	- Dr. Barber tells him, "You're going to have to eat a lot. I put an extra heart in it. Extra horsepower in this one. Human, but almost so perfect it's on the verge of being creepy", 
	- Tony responds, "I want to be human"
- Tony has Angelina 3 help Dr. Barber with the surgery
	- Dr. Barber beckons the party to his surgery auditorium and says to Tony, "One last time. Are you ready to see with living eyes?"
	- Tony agrees, so Dr. Barber flips the switch and electric flies. Both bodies jolt, and neither move
- The doctor looks around and says, "Just a moment. just another moment... gotta work out the kinks in the machine!" and starts hitting it. Pounds on the chest of the large body and yells, "Live, dammit!"
	- The large body springs to life 
	- Tony in deep voice, "I feel like I should go by Antonio now" 
	- Dr. Barber proclaims, "It gives all of it! Strength, Dexterity, Athletics, and magic!! Made with some spare parts I had lying around from something angelic" 
- Reed asks Tony after the surgery, "Is this what you wanted, Mr. Garp?" 
	- Tony says, "Yes. I want to be human. I'm so happy with this body"
- Reed suggests that they get something to eat in town to commemorate Tony's new body 
- Bigtooth asks if they have a hideout he can lay low in while they're in town because of his outstanding warrants 
	- Reed's house serves as a hideout because it's in the boonies 
- Reed wakes up in the morning and tries to teach Muddy and Petra Common 
- Finn relaxes and tries to determine if the gold is cursed. 
- Tony is obsessed with his new body and does calisthenics 


## Since We Found Out
- The party returns to their hometown worn and haggard, but looking more experienced in the world and the river
	- Word travels quickly. Crowds begin to build, and a celebration begins
- The jovial crowd welcomes them off the ship, put laurels around their neck, and hand them food and drinks. People embrace the party and kiss them 
	- The mayor shakes their hands and says, "We really can't thank you enough. You single handedly destroyed the sharkin gang that was threatening the town"
- Minksi's house is one of the nicest in town. An old tabaxi man is laid out on a bed. A younger, gnomish weapon tends to him carefully and dabs at his face while she cries 
- "The old tabaxi says, "That's.... That's my daughter's crew. Where is she?"
	- Reed says, "She would have been leading the way if she could"
	- The tabaxi responds, "I took it as an omen, the moment she left with that boat, I fell terribly ill. That's the funny thing about these devil ships. The only thing keeping me alive was that boat. My daughter died as she lived."
- The gnome bursts into sobs about how she only wished Minksi could have believed how much her parents loved and taken care of her 
	- The tabaxi responds "That was never her way. You can't fault her for it"
- The old tabaxi grabs Reed by the wrist and says, "She trusted out as her first mate. I have no heirs after Minksi. You seem good. Minksi didn't trust many people, and not many people trusted her"
	- Reed responds, "I'm going to be Minksi's eye. For better or for worst, she's going to see the world through me"
	- Mr. Minksi reaches for Reed and says, "Thank you," then his hand drops as he dies
- The gnome says, "Truth be hold, Minksi's father was always a bit of a drunk. Useless. An asshole. He was a sweet man. As sweet as any man. When I was younger I thought he'd be taking care of me. But then I found myself taking care of him"
- The gnome asks if they want a new executive assistant, and says that she was the one taking care of the company's affairs 
- Reed asks, "Did you love them?" and tries to determine if the gnome's response is genuine. She gets the feeling that the woman is genuinely mourning their deaths
	- Gnome says that Captain Minksi was a child that lives... lived off her father's allowance
- The gnome ushers them back to the celebration
	- Reed says "I don't want to leave you all alone. You lost a husband and a daughter all within moments of each other"
	- The gnome insists that she will be fine 

## Anything Could Happen
- The party returns to the celebration and are badgered by the celebrants for a story. Finn recounts what the party has been through:
- "There we were. When the sharkin suddenly attacked the town and a man died right next to me and handed me a magic chest. This guy used to be a porcelain doll and a man in the next town took his arm and replaced it with a wildly ineffective baby arm. We got caught by more sharkins, but we flew over the falls. We killed a bunch of crocodiles, one bigger than the biggest building here. We found an old elf man in a cave." 
- People are shocked by the mention of the elf, "An elf! What happened with the elf!" 
	- Finn tells them, "He gave us wisdom, and just kind of died," then continues:
- "We saw a snake rune. I always knew snakes are terrible omens. We found a terrible substance that ate everything it touched. The river turned to blood, and we found a demon. We didn't take any boons, we would never do that" then winks at Tony"
- "We found a medusa cave and it turned us all to stone, except for Reed. Reed killed it at the last minute. We had to do some favors to this priest that were quite unsavory, but we did them. We also found a huge waterfall that we had to bargain with our devil for with our lives 
	- Reed says. "We couldn't have made it back home if it weren't for Captain Minksi"
	- Angelina 3 says, "But we did take the boon. That's why I can talk now. And we did release a demon from hell," and Reed redirects the conversation
- As everyone parties and gets medals put on them, kissed by prettiest people in town, there's suddenly a huge shake and everything dies down. In the silence is a huge roar and rip, thunder coming from the ground, as a huge earthquake tears the town almost in half
- Session ends as tentacles begin to rise up, grabbing at civilians pulling them into the black abyss
