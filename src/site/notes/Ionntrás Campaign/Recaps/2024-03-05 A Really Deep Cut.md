# What Happened? 
## Bad Blood
 -  The party manages to break free of the fog and can hear the sounds of the river 
- They're only able to enjoy the normal sights and sounds for a bit before the experienced noses on the ship recognize a  shift of the smell to copperish before the river starts turning darker and darker red into what looks to be blood 
	- The phenomena is unfamiliar to Captain Minksi, but she pretends that her dad told her about it and says that he told her, "One day you're going to navigate the Great River of Blood," and that they may be approaching the Bones of the Titan that are still bleeding
	- Tony asked if that scared her, and she responds "My dad may have been a questionable father, but when it came to matters of the sail, we were like captain and first mate. When it came to other stuff like parenting, not so much"
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] says his uncle was a good guy that took care of him and taught him to garden and cook 
	- Tony ponders if he ever had an uncle 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] points out a break to the right where it seems that the blood is coming from the side river 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony Garp\|Tony Garp]] says, "Captain Minksi, I really liked how you said that this could be from the bones still bleeding. Maybe we could test some of the blood"
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] dips the tip of her tail in the blood, but nothing happens. She licks it off and it tastes gross 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] has been quietly fishing, but has only been able to catch seaweed 
- Captain Minksi knocks on the devil hatch
	- The devil says, "Leave me alone!" and Minksi tells it they're having a vote 
	- The devil says, "This isn't a democracy"
- Tony says, "Remember, Angelina, we're voting to not go on the blood river," and Angelina votes to go down the blood river 
- The party goes down the smaller river. It's slow going, and the river becomes too shallow for the boat. They can see what looks like a small crag or cliffside where a strong, steady, and furious current of the foul blood rushes 
- Tony looks through the [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Spyglass\|Spyglass]] and sees a cave 
	- Tony says, "Captain, look!" and she instinctively puts it up to her eyepatched eye
- Captain Minksi puts her hand in the blood and smears if on her face and a rash develops 
- Tony has Angelina manhandle him to the entrance 
- There's no mistaking that the blood is coming from this cave as it rushes out

## You Live With Ghosts
- Captain Minksi looks for symbols on the cave walls and sees some strange, old, brutal writing in a caked substance on the walls 
	- She then takes an empty potion bottle and fills it with blood 
- Inside are giant jagged bone fragments sticking out of the blood, glowing rubies and the same unknown language sits a heaving figure, from which blood spurts out. Its Huge bat wings sit pathetically at the ground 
	- He groans  as he shifts and his head lulls in the party's direction. His voice is too low to reach
	- He's covered in ritual scarring, has cloven hooves, wears a kilt of a monster never seen in their worst nightmares, and has a goat head
- Captain Minksi calls for a vote and asks if he was placed here as punishment for some kind of sin 
	- Tony says, "This is terrible,"
	- Minksi says, "Tomy, what if he wanted to kill all of us? And the world"
- Reed says, "What if I talked to him and you guys stay here?"
	- Captain Minksi retorts, "What if he unholy smites you?"
	- Reed says, "Then I get unholy smited and you guys are fine,"
	- Minksi says, "No, captain goes down with the ship"
- The party hears a voice in their mind speak begging to heal the wound in his side and they will have whatever boon they speak of him
- Captain Minksi says, "Who are you?" and he says, "A powerful and respected lord of the realms," Minksi asks who
	- The devil starts talking in an angry Abyssal and deals psychic damge to everyone
	- Minksi asks what the boon is and what his name is
	- The devil says, "It would take an eon in your time just to understand the titles I have held," then tells them that the house of the goat is one of the great four houses in the abyssal region
- Reed investigates the wound to try to fix him, but Captain Minksi grabs her wrist and says that they should try to find out more about the boon first 

>[!redacted]

- The demon says that he can grant whatever power they want 
	- Captain Minksi says she wants to be the greatest captain in the world 
	- Finn says he wants to travel all of the Beastlands, and Minksi says that he can do that anyway 
	- Reed says there's nothing that she wants. The devil says that he can grant her power, love, gold, but Reed says she already has that all and says, "I don't want for much"
	- Tony wants to be a real boy 
	- Reed says, "I guess... I practice magic. I'd like my magic to be more powerful"
- Finn asks what his agenda is if he gets out and is told, "Gather my house and my ring of power and ride down the usurper and crush his bones into an infinite dust"
- Reed says, "I want to help him, but not without your permission, captain"
	- Captain Minksi says that she doesn't trust him and that they're mere cockroaches to him
	- The demon says that their captain has locked them to an unfortunate fate 
- The demon lifts one hand with more gold than they could spend in a lifetime, and the other hand with glowing scrolls, magic weapons. He says, "I can even tell you who sold your soul"
- Reed says, "I know how to fix him. Just say the word, captain, and I won't,"
	- Captain Minksi says, "You really scare me when you get like this, Reed," and Reed asks, "Like what?"
	- Minksi responds, "Never mind"
- Captain Minksi sits down and thinks then tells the devil that she's not making the deal 

## Now It's All Rusted
- The party takes on another point of exhaustion as they trudge back to the boat. Reed takes the most damage as boils and rashes develop on her and her hair starts to fall out 
- Back on the boat, Tony gives his only gold star to Captain Minksi and walks away 
	- Minksi nods sagely 
- The party travels through the dusk and sees the lights of a small town 
	- Captain Minksi says, "I've got a feeling it's gonna be the last town for a while, so we should probably sleep here"
- Captain Minksi knocks on the devil hatch and says, "Hello?"
	- The devil responds, "What you want?"
	- Minksi asks, "How much do you know about the abyss? And like, devils? Are they the same thing? I never understood all that"
	- The devil says, "Devils and demons are as different as oil and water"
	- Minksi asks if it knows anything about the House of Goats 
	- There's silence and it closes his devil door 
	- Minksi asks if he wants to drink some abyssal blood, and if that would be good revenge 
	- The devil says, "Word of advice, just never get on the bad side of whatever House of Goat you deal with"
	- Finn says, "Hypothetically, what if I had a friend that had the opportunity to help a House of the Goat and was even offered a boon, but didn't"
	- The devil laughs and says that they might as well just kill themselves 
	- Minksi says, "He said I had a fucked up fate! And that I don't have a soul!"
- Tony says, "Do you feel guilty that you're not helping a dying person right now? I just have a thing where it sucks to be alone and no one is helping him"
- Captain Minksi jumps into the river and lays in his back and contemplates her doomed fate, then starts shouting for help 
	- Finn goes in to help, but Minksi warns him about the eels 
	- Minksi says, "Good news, we don't need that devil boon. I just got bitten by a white eel, and it is seen as a gentle river guardian. It is seen as good luck, but it is also seen as bad luck if it attacks you"
- Reed says, "I can go back by myself, spare you all his wrath"
	- Captain Minksi says, "Reed, how many times do I have to tell you that you're not a sacrificial lamb"
	- Reed says, "I'm not a sacrificial lamb, I'm being practical"
	- Minksi says, "A sacrificial mountain goat then,"
	- Reed says, "I guess that's more fitting given the context"

## Now We Got Problems
- The party enters the town's tavern 
	- Captain Minksi asks the barkeep if there's any healers in the town 
	- The barkeep says, "The mayor can perform some cantrips"
	- Minksi says, "Cantrips? And you made him mayor?"
	- The barkeep says, "I like John! I voted for him three times, and I'll vote for him again! You riverrunners are all the same"
	- Minksi says she'll trade some gold for food and drink, and the barkeep says it will be 10 gold pieces 
	- Minksi drags her claws against the counter and smacks a gold piece against it and says, "Food and drink to my crew. Now." 
	- Minksi returns to the table emptyhanded and says, "Guys, when I'm hangry, don't have me be the one to deal with people"
- Captain Minksi stands up and says, "We're getting that boon"
	- Finn says, "I thought we were going to rest first"
	- Minksi asks Tony if he can make her a mask to hide her now scarred face
>[!redacted]


- Reed sneaks away to the barkeep and manages to haggle with him to buy some food
	- Reed returns to the table with dark beers, rye bread, and too salty eel soup and says, "Here, captain. Eat up"
	- Captain Minksi asks where she got it from, and Reed says that she got it from the barkeep, who told them to keep it lowkey 
- Tony and Finn stay behind to get rooms
	- Reed pounds the rest of the beers on the table and goes with Captain Minksi to seek out the mayor 
- Captain Minksi knocks on the mayor's door and a very timid man with deep-sunken in eyes asks what they've come for 
	- Minksi asks if there's a man of god that can heal her disfigurement
	- Mayor John says that they have the stigmata and that they're cursed 
	- John says that the meteor foretold their coming, and that they've brought misfortune upon the town 
	- Reed says that they can stop another meteor from coming because bad things come in twos. Minksi says that she's heard that bad things come in threes. John says, "Yeah, the meteor and you two"
	- John shuts the door 
- Captain Minksi says they should go to the general store to see if they can buy some healing potions 
	- Reed says that she doesn't think healing potions will be sufficient to heal their wounds, but follows along
	-  They find Mayor John manning the store 
	- John offers them three Potions of Healing for 20 gold pieces 
	- Neither of them have that much, so Reed offers to do any work that needs to be done around the town
	- Minksi manages to trade 5 gold pieces and her bag of gold fish scales 
- Captain Minksi and Reed return to the tavern and the barkeep tells them that their friends got a room with four beds and left a note 
	- Minksi reads the note and runs off 
	- Reed reads it and finds that Tony and Finn had returned to the cave 

## Did You Have To Do This?
- Captain Minksi and Reed find that they had left the boat behind 
	- Reed gives Minksi a dose of Pixie Dust and tells her to give it to the devil 
	- Minksi tells the devil to bring them back to the cave, but the devil refuses to go anywhere near the House of the Goat 
	- Reed offers the devil her soul 
	- Minksi gets on er knees and says that she doesn't have any family, just her crew, who she's starting to see as her friends, and begs the devil to help her 
	- The devil says that he'll bring them there, but they have to take the demon's wand and give it to him and give him all the crew's souls upon their death 
- Meanwhile, Finn and Tony have returned to the demon, with Tony apologizing to Finn the entire way
- Tony tells the demon that he'll help him in exchange for three wishes each for the party, to which the demon agrees 
- Tony performs a medicine check on the demon and finds something shouldn't be in there 
	- With Angelina 3's help he manages to pull out a 10 pound pink crystal 
- The demon laughs and grows larger and asks what they want 
- Captain Minksi and Reed arrive and Minksi starts berating Tony for disobeying her orders 
- Tony wishes for a powerful new hand for Captain Minksi, Finn asks for an unheard boon, and then the demon tells them to state their third wish 
	- Tony protests and says that he asked for three wishes for each person, but the demon laughs and tells him that he can't uncork the bottle he's opened 
	- Minksi wishes for the demon's wand, for her face to be fixed, and for her soul to be returned 
	- The demon laughs and says that the wand is a mere pittance and drops it to the ground at her feet 
- The demon says that he is what stands at the gate of the hells, laughs as he grows impossibly large until he transcends the plane and disappears 
- Captain Minksi admonishes Tony for disobeying her orders, unleashing a demon that will destroy the world, and leaving her disfigured 
	- Tony maintains that he was just trying to help 
- Angelina 3 suddenly manifests a mouth and says, "That's not very nice"
- Captain Minksi picks Tony up and breaks the wrist of his baby arm
	-  Minksi then leaves as fast as she can and returns to the boat
- The rest of the party return and find a note on the boat:
		- five cut out stars out on the deck with the note that says "thanks for the hand. -capt PS: NOT FORGIVEN YET!"
- Captain Minksi examines the wand before giving it to the devil per their agreement

## Still Got Scars
- The party returns to the tavern and settle into their room 
- Captain Minksi sits on her bed like a gargoyle with her back to the party and her fur bristled 
	- Reed says to Minksi in Elvish, "Say the word and I'll kill Tony"
- Tony and Finn discuss how Tony can get back into Captain Minksi's good graces 
	- Finn suggests killing the demon, but Tony says that they should imprison him again and make him suffer 
	- Finn says that Tony could just keep on killing bandits, catching the captain fish, and doing a good job 
	- Finn suggests that she might forgive him if he saves her life 
	- Tony asks what he should do if Finn's about to save the captain's life, and if he should kill Finn to take the credit

>[!redacted]



- Captain Minksi wakes up with goop on her face, some kind of herb that she licks

	- Pus and rot runs down Minksi's face

>[!redacted]


- Captain Minksi takes one of the healing potions they bought, blots some on a cloth, and has Tony wipe it on her face, then takes necrotic damage
	- Minksi says she's cursed, and that the gods are dead and can't help 
	- Tony says that there's hippies in nature that may be able to help, but Minksi says they won't be enough
	- Minksi explains to Angelina 3 what an injury is, and that some injuries can only be cured by a god 
	- Angelina 3 asks what a god is, and Minksi says, "A god is an all-powerful being that can do whatever it wants"

	- Minksi says they should go into the woods to find something to make a mask from 
	- Tony says that he's been working on one using a floor plank from the tavern 
	- Minksi says, "That's a good draft, but we need a mask that matches my beauty"
- As Captain Minksi asks where Reed is, the ground starts shaking 
- Suddenly Tony is hanging by his fingertips above a chasm filled with dark water 
	- Finn and Angelina 3 try to pull Tony up while Captain Minksi looks on 
	- Angelina 3 almost drops Tony, and for a moment as the waves lap his feet he thinks he feels something else in the water try to pull him down, but they're able to pull him up
- Captain Minksi asks Tony what else in the water
	- Tony looks in with the Spyglass and drops dead
- Session ends as Tony's body suddenly starts shaking and seizing and his head spins 360 degrees and says, "I'm back! Me and the devil made a deal!"
