# What Happened? 
## Stay In Bed, Float Up Stream
- The chasm has now cooled and the water no longer roils with something underneath 
- Seems to have been potentially an earthquake that ruptured the underground water that contaminated the soil with a dark substance 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] scoops up a little bit of the dark water and finds that it's full of some kind of substance; almost oily, but does not smell like oil 
	- She tentatively licks it and it tastes like foul dirt 
- Captain Minksi suggests looking for Reed, but says that she'll find her way back to the hotel and jokes about how she's searching for boons
	- Minksi and Finn discuss how they should try to get better boons next time 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] tells Captain Minksi that she might be able to break a wall with her new porcelain hand, so she punches it and nothing happens 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony Garp\|Tony Garp]] says, "Boy am I tired! I can't wait to go to bed"
	- Finn asks Angelina 3 if she's also ready for bed and she says, "What is sleep?"
	- Finn tries to explain sleep to Angelina 3 who asks, "What happens when you close your eyes?"
	- Finn says that he sometimes vividly hallucinates for eight hours 
	- Angelina 3 asks if it's scary, and Finn says it's quite relaxing 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] wakes up early and takes Petra for a walk by the river 

>[!redacted]


- Reed is noticeably sluggish on the sails and rigging and moving the oars, but before long they make great pace on track to their destination 
	- Captain Minksi tells Reed, "Stop drying your boots! I don't care if you're taking care of a baby now"
	- Reed says, "I'm teaching her the ropes. It's never too early to learn how to sail" 
	- Captain Minksi agrees and says that the baby could be a free crew member that she doesn't need to pay, and that kids should work
	- Reed agrees and says that it builds character 
- Skin from Captain Minksi's face peels off 
	- Reed asks if it hurts and is told that it hurts incredibly bad 
	- Reed says that their next stop should be finding a way to fix it 
- Tony tells Captain Minksi she could use her treasure to fix her face 
	- Minksi tells Tony that she's sick of him and slaps him and calls him a freak
- Captain Minksi tells the party that they must pass the titan's bones 
- Captain Minksi asks Tony how he's still alive, and he says that since she sold their souls to the devil, the devil brought him back to life in exchange for 10% of their gold 
	- Minksi tells him that it's a terrible deal because she gets 90% of the gold, so now the rest of the crew get nothing 
	- Finn protests, but Minksi says it's fair because she gets 90% of the curses 
- Reed opens the devil's hatch and gives it a dose of pixie dust  but there's no reaction
	- Captain Minksi tries to talk to the devil, but finds that it's asleep 
	- Tony says that the devil told him it would be asleep for a long time after using all that energy to bring him back to life 

## The Water's Always Changing, Always Flowing
- Captain Minksi notices that the river has shifted and does not look like what it should from the map; some kind of event has altered it slightly. The water seems darker here. She sees what seems like eels at first underneath the surface ahead, but they don't appear quite right 
	- Minksi tells Reed to try to catch one but not reel it in 
- Reed casts her rod and almost right away feels the tension of something taking the bait
	- The rod suddenly doubles over as the string goes taut and she almost loses her rod, but she's able to brace herself against the side of the boat
	- Captain Minksi helps Reed try to lift up the creature so they can examine it and they find a mass of tentacles, and for just a moment under the water appears a mouth big enough to swallow the river 
- Finn asks Tony if that looks familiar to him, and Tony says, "I can't say it does"
- The creature can still be seen beneath the water and seems almost docile
- Captain Minksi ponders if they should take a different route and knows that there will be a lot of angry wildlife, but nothing like the tentacle monster they saw
	- Finn tells Captain Minksi that he wants to throw a rock at it 
- Reed is able to slowly get the boat turned around to the next river that shouldn't take the party too far off course 
- Reed says, "Captain Minksi, when we're on land, can I talk to you about something?"
	- Minksi says she can, and that they can talk about it now on the water, but Reed says, "No. On land."
	- Minksi tries to determine if Reed is trying to throw a mutiny, but Reed's demeanor is the same as it always is 

## Maybe He's As Scared As Me
- Spiders stand on the surface tension of the water and have not attacked yet
	- Finn holds an attack for if he gets into range of a spider 
	- Captain Minksi knows that the spiders are opportunist hunters and fires her crossbow at the closest spider, then hides ins the interior of the boat
	- Reed shoots a Fire Bolt at the same spider and misses 
- A spider attack Finn and paralyzes his leg 
- Tony briefly collapses, then gets back up and says, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't know what got over me"
	- Tony is then attacked by a spider, but he's able to resist their poison 
	- The other spider seems to be waiting for something 
- Finn fires his sling at a spider 
	- Minksi was unsuccessful in her hiding and shoots her crossbow at a spider, then backs away
	- Angelina 3 casts Shocking Grasp on the closest spider, then Tony fires his sling at it 
	- Angelina 3 then tries to slam into the spider and barely hits it
	- Reed shoots a fire bolt at the same spider and its legs retract within itself as it bobs down into the water dead 
- A spider tries to attack Reed but misses 
	- Finn manages to kill the spider as he lays down paralyzed on the ground and wildly flails at the spider with his daggers  
- One of the spiders lies in wait as the boat proceeds, but Captain Minksi sees a net-like web across the river under the water  
	- Captain Minksi slows the boat down to keep it from getting caught in the web
	- Tony fires a Witch Bolt at the waiting spider 
	- Angelina 3 lights the web on fire with the alchemist's fire, then gets caught in it 
	- Reed shoots a fire bolt at the spider 
- The remaining spider attacks Angelina 3, who screams in pain under the water 
	- Finn hits the spider with his sling, which hits the spider with some kind of explosive force that almost kills it 
	- Captain Minksi dives into the water and uses her cat claws to slice the web open, but her hands becomes stuck 
- The boat slams into the web and crushes the spider to death; flipping the boat over the bow, and dumping everyone into the rocks and water
	- Captain Minksi manages to break the web 
- Angelina 3 thanks Captain Minksi, who says, "No problem, Angelina! You poor, poor sentient thing!"
- Captain Minksi tries to push the boat over to the bank 
	- Everyone pitches in, but Reed and Minksi are almost exclusively that manage to effectively contribute
- Captain Minksi drags a spider corpse onto the shore to see if she can harvest the venom gland with Tony's help 
	- They're able to find a bit of the venom gland, enough for one usage 
	- Minksi gives it to Tony; who takes it with the intent of creating a means of mithridatizing the party against it

## What I Dream, The Day Might Send
- The river eventually opens up from the narrow, spider-infested, rough section of river. Around the bend is a huge, strange skull made of strange colors that are reminiscent of stained glass and weatherworn 
- A field of white flowers surrounds a gigantic skeleton 
- Captain Minksi, "Imagine how big this thing's penis must have been"
	- Tony says, "Captain, you know the taller they are, the smaller they are"
	- Minksi gets mad and denies his statement  
	- Finn becomes contemplative and says, "I think I have heard this"
- Captain Minksi says, "We must climb the correct waterfall, then we will sail over an ancient lake over a sunken city where a secret, awesome treasure lies"
	- Newer, but still ancient and rough Elvish writing on the map says, "Towards the head of the river"
- Tony says that he's been working on a new spider-like, moving piece of yarn homunculus that he could send ahead if they have a gem
	- Captain Minksi asks Tony if he only values life it if meets his standards of sentience 
	- Tony says in regard to Angelina 3, "I really think she wanted to talk to you, captain. I mean, I gave her life, but she respects you more"
	- Minksi brings up how Angelina 3 used up one of their boons 
	- Angelina 3 responds, "I didn't mean to. I didn't know"
	- Captain Minksi asks if Angelina 3 can remember when she couldn't talk 
	- Angelina 3 says, "Sort of. It was kind of like dreaming"
	- Minksi says, "Yay! You figured out dreaming!" and gives Angelina 3 a gold star 
	- Tony asks Angelina 3 if someone else besides him were to give her an order if she would obey it, and she says that it depends on if she likes them 
- Captain Minksi uses her navigator's tools to try to find a sense of where the head of the waterfall is 
	- The head of a river is known to be known as an impossible place from the Seven Rivers that flow from the Phase Hands  One will often say in a chiding manner, "And I'll meet you at the head of the river with all the kings of the Seven Splinter Peaks"
- Finn suggests that Minksi becomes the best captain by sailing through the Phase Hands and finding the head of the river 
	- Minksi says that no one will respect her with her fucked up face
- The party pulls up to an area with a gigantic skeleton and anchor the boat so they can explore 

## But I Think You're Moving Too Fast
- Despite the bones' extreme age, they still have a shimmery quality to them that's almost like oil slick; highlighted against the thick bed of white flowers 
- Captain Minksi tries to chip at the bones with her dagger, but it's very solid. She taps the bone and crystalline thud resounds
- Reed goes into the skull and finds the word "Danger" written in Elvish in a similar handwriting to the Elvish scratched into the map tablets
	- Reed says, "Captain Minksi, remember inside the temple when the door said 'doom'? This skull says 'danger'"
- Tony casts Detect Magic and finds that the bones and flowers gives off celestial magic 
	- Tony asks, "It's celestial, how can it be dangerous?"
	- Reed smells the flowers and finds that they smell like honey and chamomile. She digs around the flowers, but only finds that the soil is of very good quality
	- Captain Minksi eats one and finds that it's sweet 
>[!redacted]


- Reed sees that the skull looks similar to the one she found with a snake inside it in the water outside the temple and points this out to the party
- Tony has heard of these flowers called god's blood, and knows vaguely that they're said to bring good luck or terrible ills 
	- People may give a single god's blood to a newlywed or place one on a child's grave if they died young 
	- Captain Minksi worries that she'll get cursed again because she ate one, and Finn says that she's had so much bad luck that it'll probably give her good luck
- Captain Minksi knocks on the devil's door and says, "I heard you cut a deal with one of my crew"
	- The devil says that technically they're all his crew; which Minksi vehemently denies and states that she is the captain 
	- The devil says that it could take the boat up any of the waterfalls if Minksi just tells it that they're its loyal crew 
	- Minksi refuses and says, "I got you this," and drops a god's flower into the hatch 
	- The devil says, "Alright, gay boy"
	- Minksi sits cross-legged on teh boat and says to herself, "I am not a gay boy. I am not a gay boy," takes a deep breath, and returns to the party 
- Tony says that he's almost done working on Captain Minksi's hand and presents a skeletal hand he had crafted 
	- Tony says that Minksi could try offering the devil her hand, then throw down the hand he made 
	- Minksi says that devil wouldn't fall for it and she would probably instantly lose her hand the moment she proposes it 
- Reed asks Captain Minksi if they can talk now that they're on land; then leads Minksi inside the skull to speak in private 
	- Reed says, "Remember when you were all stone? The devil told me to throw you all overboard"
	- Minksi asks why it said that and Reed says, "It was... heavily implied that it does not like your management style. It said I would make a great captain"
	- Minksi tells Reed that she could become a great captain one day, but not as good as her 
	- Reed says, "Perhaps one day my path will lead me there. But right now it leads me to you"
	- Minksi tells Reed that she's strong for resisting the temptation to take its offer, and that she's glad to have her as first mate. Minksi says Reed's been a good friend to her; except for the time she was randomly very rude at the temple and asks why she did that 
	- Reed apologizes again and says that something that No Eyes said unnerved her 
	- Minksi asks what he said, and Reed responds that it is nothing of consequence at this time 
	- Minksi tells Reed that she trusts her and doesn't push the matter further
- Captain Minksi asks the devil if there's something else that it will trade for besides her dignity, her hand, or their souls. The devil says that those are its favorite things
	- Minksi offers the devil some pixie dust, and it says that it doesn't need any because it woke up with a bunch of it  
	- The devil says that it picked Minksi for a reason. She asks why, and it responds, "In due time"
- As Captain Minksi tries to bargain with the devil, Reed dives in the water to investigate. The water is incredibly clear and the bedrock glimmers, but she doesn't find anything of note
	- Reed stands beneath the waterfall and is able to avoid being thrown back from its force, but does not find anything within or behind it 
- Reed returns to the party sopping wet. Captain Minksi asks if she found a way up, and she says she didn't 
	- Minksi asks Reed if she has an idea of which waterfall they're supposed to go up. Reed says, "Whichever one we take will take us where we're supposed to be" 
	- Minksi points out that the note said to go up the correct waterfall; which implies that there are incorrect waterfalls 
	- Reed says that she believes they're meant to go up the most dangerous one, and Minksi reluctantly agrees 
	- Minksi asks Reed if she can talk to the devil, but Reed says she shouldn't because she's not the captain, but will if needed and to just say the word 

## Always Watching Out For Which And Whethers
- Captain Minksi returns to the devil to try to bargain again, but ends up arguing with it and not getting anything in return
- Reed says that she will make a deal with the devil and asks that everyone leave to give her space to talk to it 
	- The rest of the party goes into the skull while Reed goes to the devil's hatch 

>[!redacted]


- Reed calls the party back to the boat and tells them that the devil will help them 
	- Finn asks Reed what he offered the devil, and she says, "I have a lot of pixie dust"
	- Tony tries to discern if Reed's okay, but isn't able to read her
- The water relaxes again and the water becomes normal. The party begins to speed down it with the devil's assistance and begin seeing shapes of architecture deep under the water 
- Minksi says that's where the sunken city is and where the terrible awesome treasure is 
	- Finn asks what they'll do if there's women there, and Minksi says that she'll have first dibs
- Tony yells, "Charge!" and rushes at Reed with the dagger she had given him 
	- Tony and Reed spar. Reed does not go easy on him, and eventually Captain Minksi tells them to cut it out because they're looking for treasure

## Always Running Out Of Time
-  Reed suddenly collapses 
- Captain Minksi rushes over and finds no pulse 
- Tony casts Cure Wounds, but there's no effect 
- Captain Minksi asks the devil what Reed offered, and the devil says that it decided to split up the 100 years she gave it 
	- Minksi asks if it will negotiate the 100 years 
	- The devil says that it wants 8 hours of Reed's life every day 
	- Minksi says that the 8 hours have to be at night, if that's okay with Reed 
	- Reed is brought back to life and says, "I've never been one for the night. I've always preferred the morning"
- The devil says they also have to pour out the shitty devil's oil, but Minksi refuses and says that they're going to keep at least one in case they need to subdue it
	- Reed dies again 
	- Minksi asks the devil if it needs a good first mate to run, and if it just wants to stay in the docks all day. The devil responds that it would be a nice vacation
	- The devil says the throw out all shitty devil's oil they have it will cut the deal down to 50 years 
- Reed comes back to life and agrees to the deal 

## You Just Long John Silver
- Captain Minksi asks how they're going to get down to the city. Tony says that if he shuts down Angelina 3 for a few hours he can make Caps of Water Breathing 
	- Angelina 3 says, "I don't want to be shut down" 
	- Tony tries to convince Angelina 3 by saying that it will be just like going to sleep and Angelina 3 cries, "But Reed dies every time she goes to sleep!"
	- Angelina 3 says, "I don't want to die! I want to run in a field!"
	- Captain Minksi promises Angelina 3 that she'll get to run through the field of white flowers they had encountered, or a different field if they can't return to it 
- There is an opening to a half-sunken temple. As they enter ot, the mixture of the glassy reflection and the structures of the underwater seem to blend together to create the feeling that they're very high up
- The room seems empty beside cool humid air. At the far end of the room is an old, weathered skeleton draped over a box
- Captain Minksi says to be careful because abandoned cities tend to be trapped up the wazoo 
- The party slowly and carefully proceeds through. They can see that the skeleton is wearing a classic, old naval coat. Despite being covered in some brine is a still gleaming, sharp cutlass, and a pirate's hat 
	- Captain Minksi dusts off the hat and puts it on very proudly 
	- Finn takes the sword. The way it gleams despite the thick dust suggests that it is potentially enchanted. He swings it and finds that it feels very light 
	- Tony ritual casts Detect Magic and finds magic coming from the skeleton's coat, the sword, and sources of magic from within the box the skeleton is gripping 
- Captain Minksi grabs the coat and gently pulls it away from the box. The skeleton collapses, and the skull looks at Minksi as it falls to the ground. Something rattles inside it 
	- Minksi puts on the coat and asks if she looks snazzy. Tony says she looks picture perfect 
- Tony looks inside the skull with the [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Spyglass\|Spyglass]] and finds something metal within. He asks Captain Minksi if he should grab it; and she says yes, but it's hers 
	- Tony tells Angelina 3 to smash it and she says, "Aye aye, captain," while looking at Minksi 
	- Angelina 3 smashes the skull, revealing a key-like object 
- The stone box looks like the box that the tablets were found in with the same handwriting as the maps in Elvish: "the horror, the horror" then becomes illegible after
	- The box has one small opening that seems to be the same shape as the key 
- Captain Minksi puts the key in the box and a hairline opening spreads. The box hisses as it opens 
- A loud, gruff voice suddenly calls out, "Hello my lovelies! It seems I've finally caught up to you at last," as an entire crew of hulking sharkins stand at the entrance with weapons in their hands and murderous gleams in their eyes 
- Session ends as one particularly large, pure white sharkin with a captain hat and an anchor over his arm points at the party and says, "You certainly gave us the runabout. But you don't know nothing about sharks once there's blood in the water"
