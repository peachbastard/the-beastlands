# What Happened? 
## Praise For Them Springing Fresh From The World
- The islands have become more and more narrow straits between the islands until they become canyons and the water flows faster 
- The party is entering a slightly underground chamber between two steep walls, tall and crooked enough where the sky can no longer be seen. There's decent lighting from the various naturally lit fungi and lichen
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] wakes up early and does push ups on the water and catches thin cave fish
	- She offers the fish to Captain Minksi, and apologizes for it being meager
	- Minksi asks if anyone has crackers, and is disappointed when no one does, saying that it would be a good charcuterie board 
- Reed offers Muddy some fish and is pecked for her efforts. She thanks him for the training
	- Captain Minksi says that she should teach him some tricks 
	- Reed says she's been training him and yells, "Muddy, attack!" but he just cocks his head at her
	- Minksi sarcastically congratulates her, and Reed says, "Thank you, captain"
- Reed says, "Mr. Tony, does your... pet also need to eat?"
	- Captain Minksi asks for its name, and Tony says it's Angelina Garp 
	- Angelina tries to shove the fish bones into its face
	- Minksi asks Tony if he knows about the great wizard Pavlov, which he does, and she suggests that he uses his trainings
	- Finn asks if they should also be feeding it, and Tony says they can 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] plucks a mushroom off the cave wall and is disappointed when it stops glowing
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony Garp\|Tony Garp]] asks Reed if there's anything he can do to improve his aim with the sling
	- Reed says, "Yes, hard work. Determination, perseverance, grit. Pain. Just like my ma and pa said."
	- Tony takes his sling and shoots the mushroom out of Captain Minksi's hand, just barely skimming her fingers 
- Captain Minksi takes another mushroom, puts it on her head, and orders Tony to shoot it 
	- Tony shoots a rock into into Minksi's good eye 
	- Reed tells him this is where the pain comes in
	- Minksi lifts up her eyepatch and uses her [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Rune Eye\|Rune Eye]] to shoot a fire dart at him in retaliation 
- Captain Minksi picks up a smooth rock from the ground and hurls it at Tony, and he snatches it out of the air with his baby arm 
	- She then asks if he can do one-handed pushups with that arm, but he immediately collapses 
	- She says, "That makes sense. Babies can be  thieves, but not bodyguards"
- Tony asks if Captain Minksi was a baby thief, and she says that he doesn't remember being a baby, but does remember that her dad used to be kind to her and occasionally ask about her day 
- Reed asks if they remember when she set a bar on fire and Minksi asks, "Which time?"
	- She recounts how she once set a bar on fire, so her parents had her work on their old friends' ship at sea to teach her to value other people's property 
	- Finn asks how it was and what they do, and Reed says that it was fun spending time with her parents' friends, and that they're importers and exporters
- The party proceeds down the river, but the boat scrapes begin scraping against the walls and takes on damage

## Should I Eat Them? No
- Captain Minksi sees a large, bug-like creature with crab legs above them 
- Reed and Captain Minksi know that these cave deposits are full of lost heroes and mages; valuable for looting, but inhabited by bugs known as mage eaters that pick off river runners and neutralize any magical means they have
- Captain Minksi asks Reed if she thinks they should kill it for the gold inside, and she says that she thinks they should 
	- Finn is more hesitant, but Minksi says it's just a baby 
	- Finn asks her how she knows this, and she says that she killed one a couple weeks ago 
	- He asks how she knows how big a baby is compared to an adult, and she gets mad at him for questioning captain knowledge
- Captain Minksi tells everyone to aim for its right legs so they can topple it over, then fires her crossbow at it
	- The party hears a silent scream, feels strange insectoid feelings of pain, hunger, and fear resonate from it
	- Finn gets in closer and hides 
	- Tony shoots his sling at it, then Angelina gets closer and misses with Shocking Grasp

>[!redacted]


- The mage eater emits a psychic scream that hampers Tony and Captain Minksi 
	- It then strikes Angelina and Reed with its long legs 
- Captain Minksi tries to hit it again with her crossbow, but its strange skin deflects it and she yells, "Guys! Magic attacks only!"
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] gets closer and strikes the mage eater with his short sword and dagger 
- Tony casts Mending on the boat 
- Reed says, "Magic and non-magic weapons don't work well on these things. Makes them a fun challenge!"
	- She then strikes it once, closes her eyes and takes a deep breath then strikes again; cutting off one of its leg and cheering as its insect blood splashes on her. She then takes another deep breath and regains some health 
- The mage eater launches itself in the air and pins Reed to the ground. It then pierces a leg through her shoulder, picks her up and drinks the liquids that had splattered onto her, but she's able to avoid having her brains eaten
- Captain Minksi uses her Feline Agility to get closer, tosses Finn a rope, then tries to topple it over, but Finn isn't able to hold on and gets knocked into the river
	- Minksi yells, "I'm stuck with these smalls! I knew I should just kept being racist and stuck with my crew of strong, burly women!"
- Finn says that they should try again, then they manage to topple the creature over 
- Tony shoots his sling at the creature 
- Reed swings down as she's held aloft by the mage eater, then uses the momentum from the creature falling to stab through its head 
- Captain Minksi orders everyone to cut open the creature for treasure while Finn keeps lookout for other mage eaters 
	- Reed finds 50 gold pieces and 2 rubies, which she hands over to Minksi, and human skeletons, which she gives to Tony 
	- Tony and Minksi find a [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Spyglass\|Spyglass]] and 5 strange arrows 
	- Minksi asks Tony if he can turn the arrows into crossbow bolts, and says that he thinks he can 
- Tony investigates the spyglass and finds that it's patinaed and has a repeating wave and skull-and-bones pattern 
	- Minksi peers through it and sees that objects are magnified, making them much easier to see, and that it might help for casting spells at a distance
	- She says, "This is useless," and tosses it over her shoulder 
	- Tony catches it and says he wants it 
- Angelina floats up into the air, and Tony says, "I didn't know you could fly"
	- Another mage eater emerges from the reeds and destroys Angelina, seemingly attracted to the magic fueling the homunculus, then tosses its body aside 
- The party gets back on the boat and starts moving forward and start to see the towering bodies of the 40' mage eaters 
- Captain Minksi opens the hatch and says, "Hey, little buddy, you awake yet?" and only hears a soft wheezing in response
- Captain Minksi asks if they should try to be stealthy or fast, and Tony says that they're already scraping the walls and should go fast. Reed agrees, and the party decides to go as fast as they can 
- Tony throws a magic stone behind the boat, and the mage eaters instantaneously turn their attention to it and converge like a moving forest
	- Finn looks nervous that his cape may be attracting them
- Reed deftly darts around the ship while Captain Minksi stoically guides the boat forward and slaps a bat out of the air
	- Meanwhile, Tony and Finn flounder on the ship, and Reed has to step in as she works and stop Finn from screwing up
	- Reed says, "Captain Minksi, I think you had a point about the smalls"
	- Minksi whispers, "I know, let's leave them at the next town," and Reed agrees
- There was the sounds of small creatures, but now it's silent, almost muffled, as the party enters an underground, monotonous area 
- Tony uses his Tinkerers Tools to infuse the spyglass to grant him Darkvision and finds that it has some other additional properties
- Finn suggests that they look at the map to make sure that they're on the right course 
	- Captain Minksi commends him for the idea and says that there's the temple of the lost hero and a statue en route 
	- Finn asks if the hero is Minksi's mom, and she slaps him and tells him to keep her mom's name out of his mouth

## Room By Room, Patiently
- The party ties up the boat and senses the lights and sounds of a fire crackling, but no voices
- The party sneaks in and sees an old raggedy man with white hair and white eyes staring closely into the fire 
	- He looks up and says, "Who goes there?"
- Finn motions to Captain Minksi and makes a slicing motion with his dagger across his throat to ask if they should kill him 
- The man says, "Michael? Are you part of the pickup crew? I'm sorry... I've been here so long. I've forgotten. What gear have you come to pick up?"
	- Captain Minksi tells him, "All of them"
	- The man is silent for a moment and says, "All of them? That will take forever to load!" To which Minksi tells him that they have other guys coming up here"
	- The man asks if they have the food resupply, and Captain Minksi says, "Chef, do you have any food for him?" but the party is low on rations 
- Captain Minksi asks when the last food resupply was here 
	- He looks flustered and says, "You know... The last time it was here"
	- She asks if he knows who it was and he says, "Of course, it was Michael"
	- The man calls himself No Eyes and is worried about Michael and says he doesn't want to be left all alone down here. Minksi asks if he was going upriver or downriver 
	- She tells him to focus on when Michael was last here, he says "I lose track of time down here. Last time he left some supplies down here, they're in the corner"
	- No Eyes says they can inspect the supplies, and Minksi orders Finn and Tony to take a look and Reed to load up the gear 
-  The old crates are full of rotting fruits and animal bones 
	- Captain Minksi asks when he last ate, and No Eyes says that he had 30 spiders yesterday and that he knows because he counted them 
 - Captain Minksi tells Reed to catch the man a fish and she says, "Should I load up the gear or catch the fish?" 
	  - Minksi says, "One thing at a time, buddy," and Reed returns to the river and catches some small river crabs and a white eel with blind white eyes 
	  - Minksi says that the eel's good luck 
	  - Reed tries to ascertain if the eel's and the man's eyes look similar, but just finds that they're both white and milky
 - Captain Minksi brings No Eyes the eels, and he says, "Kraxis the Dragon birthed onto Zorastrian, who of course created the river flow. We found a way to cook the eel with dried salt from the riverbed after a long period of many moons"
	  - She says, "I hope you don't mind me asking, sir. I didn't know you were one of those elves"
	   - He looks defensive and says, "Of course I'm an elf! Wait, you're not one of our crew"
   - Captain Minksi says, "Of course I'm an elf, feel my ears," and puts her fingers over her head and tries to have him feel them
   - Reed asks, "Would you like me to catch you another eel, Mr. No Eyes?"
   - No Eyes starts shouting in Elvish and balls of fire begin to shoot in random direction from his amulet across the room, catching parts of it on fire

>[!redacted]



- Reed approaches the prone man and stabs downward, misses, takes a deep breath, then pierces her sword through his mouth

>[!redacted]

- Reed takes No Eyes' amulet and gives it to Captain Minksi 
- The fire spreads to the entrance of the room 
	- Reed uses her [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Bobtail\|magic fishing rod]] to cast Control Water to draw in a tidal wave and put the fire out by the entrance
- Reed walks through the flames to try to pry open one of the boarded up doors, but only gets it open enough to get a glance at a room made of marble 
	- Captain Minksi joins her in her search and they both take fire damage 
	- Wreathed in flames, Reed glows gold as she absorbs some of the flames, then pries the door open 
- Captain Minksi and Reed rush into the room and grab the most valuable things they can find before rushing out of the room and rejoining the rest of the party by the boat
- Reed holds out a large, bowling ball-sized statue of a fat, sluggish deity that she found
	- Minksi takes it from her and ties it on top of the boat with the other statue they found
- Captain Minksi holds out an odd-looking and finely made longsword with a few strange, unrecognizable words inscribed on it 
	- She asks if anyone uses large swords and offers it to Reed when she says she does 
	- Reed thanks her and feigns interest in the sword, but declines saying that she has a bond with [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Riptide\|Riptide]] 
	- Minksi insists that she takes it because it might be super powerful and has Elvish written on it 
	- Reed responds that she really doesn't want it if it has Elvish on it, and that she's already super powerful 
	- Minksi asks Reed what she has against elves, and Reed says that there's plenty of small elves 
	- Minksi says that small elves are just Gnomes and nobody wants to be a Gnome, then has a moment of realization where it occurs to her for the first time that she might be racist
- Captain Minksi congratulates the rest of the party on a job well done and gives them their pay of 2 gold pieces, then decides to give them 3 instead 
	- Reed says that she's fine with 2 gold pieces because she doesn't feel that she did a good job in the previous fight 
	- Minksi assures her that she earned the 3 gold pieces and was the one that killed No Eyes 
	- Minksi takes Reed's hand and draws a star on the back of it, declaring that she's trying out a new reward system and exchanging stars for presents and favors
	- Reed tells her that she doesn't need rewards because hard work is a reward of its own
- It's fairly quiet for the next stretch, begins to become more and more narrow and the water becomes faster, and the sides of the boat starts scraping
- Suddenly, the whole boat dips and ducks as it enters a series of rapids
- Reed pulls out her magic fishing rod and casts Control Water again to slow the river 
	- The party carefully navigates a series of turns as they're suddenly thrown into a large, open area 
- Huge ruined stone edifice, crumbling pillars and statues. The boat rests in a large lake that has been drilled over many years into what once seems like a well-manicured marble courtyard. The central building is several layers tall with sets of staircases in the front. The central level seems to stand at about 20' off the ground, but the rest of the building, or where it once went, once went much higher. Seems to have once been a central structure what can be seen through 
- Will be difficult to move boat through next section of narrow river, but there's a perfect place to set up camp in the ruins of some old walls
- Captain Minksi asks everyone if they want to rest, and the party decides to camp there for the night 
- The room is quieter than the cavern they just came from
- Reed goes to catch dinner and Captain Minksi joins her. The fish here are large, meaty, and colorful 
	- Reed catches a few fish, while Minksi catches 20 pound fish with golden scales
	- Minksi takes a scale to keep, then decides to take a bunch of them to grind into powder and put into things 
- Tony works on rebuilding Angelina before the party sleeps for what they assume is the night 

## Drives You Fucking Mad

>[!redacted]

- It is presumably morning by the extreme rays of light ricocheting of the stones and the birds flying overhead 
- This is the first morning that Reed has slept in
- Captain Minksi yells, "Reed? Reed?!" and Reed wakes up and grunts, "What?"
	- Minksi asks, "Why aren't you training?" and Reed responds, "Why weren't you training yesterday? Or today?"
	- Minksi says, "I train my leadership skills everyday!" and talks about how she had prevented many potentially violent altercations
	- Reed asks Minksi why she didn't use those leadership skills yesterday and prevent the fight with No Eyes, and tells her that leadership is not constant yelling
	- Minksi gets mad and asks Reed why she's being so cranky today and that she doesn't yell. Reed tells her she's yelling right now; and she responds that she's talking firmly, not yelling, and tells Reed not to gaslight her 
	- Reed says, "You don't know the meaning of the word, Lamp"
- Captain Minksi becomes enraged and tells Reed not to call her by her first name 
	- Reed disregards her and continues to refer to her by her first name 
	- Reed says she's going to catch more fish, and Minksi says that there's still some leftover from the giant fish she caught last night  
	- Reed says she's going to catch even more and calls Minksi by her first name again 
	- Minksi tells her to go fuck herself, and Reed responds, "I will," then Minksi says to do it in the boat, and Reed again says that she will 
-  Captain Minksi returns to the where Tony and Finn have been anxiously listening to the argument and complains about women 
	- Finn points out that Minksi is also a woman 
	- Minksi tells them that they have her permission to kill Reed if she turns into a monster 
- The three of them look over the map and debate whether or not they should go into the temple while Reed sits with her back to them staring at the river 
	- Finn doesn't want to go into the temple because of the snake iconography and superstitions surrounding snakes, quoting a popular saying, "Don't count your snakes with your eels"
	- Captain Minksi wants to go in because of the panther iconography, saying that she might get a boon in there 
	- Without turning around, Reed tells them to shut up about snakes, and Minksi asks her why she's being an asshole 
- Tony introduces Angelina 2 and tells it to think soft thoughts and says that this one can talk because he didn't put stitches on its mouth 
	- Captain Minksi takes a couple of the gold scales from the fish she caught and puts them on Angelina 2's eyes as the finishing touch
- As the rest of the party continues to discuss whether or not they should enter the temple, Reed dives into the river

>[!redacted]


- Reed emerges from the river and tosses a half-digested skull of a strange humanoid to Tony and says, "Here, you can use this for your freakshow"
	- She then asks if they're going into the temple or not 
	- Captain Minksi asks if she's ready to stop being an asshole and asks why she's acting this way after they grew up together  
	- Reed addresses Minksi by her first name again, and Minksi tells her that she doesn't mind being addressed by her first name casually or in the streets, but never in derision 
- Captain Minksi confirms that they will try to explore the temple, so Reed jimmies the new, strange sword in the small gap in the between the sealed doors and manages to pry it open a little, but not enough for anyone to get in
- Captain Minksi holds a dagger to Reed's throat and says, "What's my name?"
	- Reed says, "Did you forget, Lamp? Do you need me to remind you, Lamp?"
	- Minksi stabs Reed as Tony and Finn look on in horror 
- Reed says, "That's not very conducive to getting the door open, Lamp. I'm not going to fight back. It won't be a challenge."
- Captain Minksi tries to stab Reed again and misses, then says that Reed is off her crew. Reed does not protest, and does not move to help get the door opened
- The rest of the party is able to get the doors open enough for one of the smaller party members to get in 
- Finn reluctantly slides in and sees a huge squat statue holding a gorgeous ruby larger than a head, underneath is a very ancient roughly wrought spool of strange metal
	- He leaves as fast as he can and tells the party that they shouldn't explore it further and should leave 

## So Warm And Calm Inside
- Captain Minksi insists that they keep trying and asks Reed for her help opening the door, and that they can talk about whatever's going on with her later if she wants 
	- Reed says, "I will help you, Captain Minksi," and the party is able to open the door; despite Finn refusing to help this time 
- Captain Minksi enters the temple with Reed behind her and see a large slug statue with a copper bowl underneath. Upon close inspection there is a strange, shimmering layer at the bottom of it. The air smells sulphureous with incense 
- Captain Minksi puts her hand over the liquid but feels nothing, but there's similarities between the deity that was picked up and the statue in the room 
	- She pulls out a ruby and compares it against the ruby the statue's holding. In the strange half light of the room, she notices that it's not a ruby, but a gem that reflects many different colors 
	- She orders someone on the outside to bring her the slug statue they found, and Finn refuses while Tony stands back and whistles 
	- Tony eventually has Angelina 2 bring the statue to her and accompany the two inside the temple 
- Session ends as Captain Minksi places the statue inside the bowl, then the doors shut and smoke starts pouring out of it an coalescing into the shape of a creature, and Reed tries to tackle her out of the way
