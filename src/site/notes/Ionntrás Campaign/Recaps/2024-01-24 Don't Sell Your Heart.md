# What Happened? 
 ## To The Places You Will Be From
- The boat is an asymmetrical river runner design with manual and magic power 
- The party is on an empty stretch of rural riverbank, fairly quiet beside the occasional bug and eel; and it's especially quiet after being charged by sharkin hoard and the blasts of their cannons 
	- They've been going along at a high speed for a number of hours getting deeper into the Hinterlands, but have had to slow down and navigate more careful. In the rush, they were not able to grab rations
- [[Ionntr치s Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] and Captain Minski have not been alarmed by lack of food because they're accustomed to it
- [[Ionntr치s Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] asks Tony if she carves something into his skin if it's like giving him a tattoo, or like giving him cuts 
	- He says he's more porcelain and fragile 
	- She says that she wants to tattoo the map into Tony's back because the stone slabs will be inconvenient to carry around all the time 
- There are 3 slabs, each about 10 pounds 
	- Captain Minksi says that each of the crew is responsible for carrying one slab, and she will gut them like a fish if they drop it 
- [[Ionntr치s Campaign/Party/Tony\|Tony]] mentions that he's been working on something, but hasn't been able to finish it
	- Captain Minksi berates him for saying "magical nonsense" and he apologizes, then she tells him to have a spine 
	- Tony stands a little taller 
- Captain Minksi asks everyone if they want to search for the treasure
- [[Ionntr치s Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] says that they should kill the sharkin and save the town, and Captain Minksi says that she didn't care much for the town that she wasn't even from, and that, "there was too many people and it was too goddamn loud and annoying"
- Tony says, "Maybe if we save the town they will be grateful that you saved them and unite the villages"
	- Captain Minksi berates him for thinking that they can save the village when they should prioritize the treasure 
- Finn asks what kind of treasure 
- Captain Minksi asks Reed what she thinks since she's been so quiet 
- Reed says, "I apologize, did you say something to me?"
	- During this time she has caught several meaty, purple bass 
	- Captain Minksi berates her for stabbing her, and Reed reiterates that it was more of a slashing motion 
	- Reed says, "I apologize for my actions. It's something my parents used to do when I was younger to help me sleep. I had a lot of energy and would sleepwalk, so they would give me some thwacks because they said you can't have trouble sleeping if you're unconscious"
	- Captain looks a little bewildered, but agrees with the logic and tells her to never do it again

## She Gonna Teach Me How To Swim
- The boat tumbles down some rocks and starts taking some surface level damage 
	- Captain Minksi brushes it off as nothing a coat of paint can't fix, and it's like what happens when Tony takes a fall 
- Tony carefully looks at the damage and uses Mending to fix it 
- The party runs into a knot of floating trees and shrubs, and the boat slows down and something lashes out of the collective shrubs 
	- Captain Minski recognizes it as an angry electric eel that has attacked 
- The eel strikes Tony and stuns him 
- Captain Minksi fires at the eel with her bow, and it begins to start to swim away 
- Finn stabs the eel with his short sword and dagger and guts it 
- Captain Minksi looks for glands or something that will stain for a while, then she writes "The S.S. Little Death" on it 
	- She takes a bite of the eel and says that they best get going soon before its mother shows up
- Finn asks Reed if they can eat the eel, and she says that she just caught some fish, but she can catch more if needed, but the eel is pretty good 
- Getting late, party has another hour or so of daylight before it gets too dark to navigate safely 
	- Without special equipment or abilities, it could be a death sentence because many eels are nocturnal and act like piranhas 
- Captain Minksi finds a safe-looking bank on the river to camp for the night 
	- Reed deftly jumps off the boat and ties it up 
- Finn looks around for something to disguise the boat in case the sharkin come back, but doesn't find anything 
- Reed volunteers to take first watch because she can't sleep 
	- Captain Minksi says, "Don't worry, I won't slash ya," and she responds, "Thank you. I appreciate that, captain"

## Simple Minds
- Reed sees a lowkey-looking boat go by in the same direction they were heading, but doesn't investigate it 
- Captain Minksi asks if anyone saw anything in the middle of the night, and Reed says that she did 
	- Minksi says, "Don't tell me it was heading in the same direction we were heading"
	- Reed replies, "I'm not a liar, captain"
	- Minksi becomes incensed that someone might be getting the the treasure before them and orders everyone to get up and get on the boat 
- Finn asks, "What about breakfast?"
	- Minksi says, "Forget about breakfast! I went without breakfast for 21 years, and I'm 28!"
- Finn sees black diesel smoke coming from down tiver up towards where the party is heading 
	- Minksi dips her tail into the water and gives it a sniff, then licks and says it tastes like sharkin diesel 
- Minksi opens up the hatch the devil's cage and asks how fast the boat can go 
	- The devil says, "As fast as I like," and agrees to go fast 
- Minksi proposes that they tie a string across the river so that the it catches the other boat in a fire oil trap
- Tony proposes that they cut down a tree to clog up the waterway so they have to go around it 
	- Reed says, "I'm plenty strong, Captain Minksi. I can cut down a few trees"
- The party stops in a neck of the river and starts cutting down trees 
	- Reed, Tony, and Finn efficiently cut down trees; while Captain Minksi falls into the mud trying to pull up a sapling 

## This Could Take All Night
- The party continues up river for several hours until they reach the first wayfarer point 
	- These points placed at difficult points to pass and specialize in transporting boats so that people can switch over to land vehicles or use their taxi services
- Minksi says, "Hey, Mr. Devil. Knock, knock. Devil, hello?"
	- The devil yawns and is aggrevated from having to power the boat 
	- She asks it can make the boat fly, and it lets out a piercing laugh and says she doesn't have what it wants to be able to make it fly 
- The party pulls up to the wayfarer and are greeted warmly by a young river elf, which aren't true elves, but from large population of half-elves that have created their own community 
	- A young, languid boy in overalls with straw hanging out of his mouth offers to help them pass for 1 gold piece, or 2 gold pieces for a scheduled trip on the wagon 
- Minksi asks, "How much for an emergency 'my young porcelain son's arm is broken' trip?"
	- Tony breaks his arm and screams, and the river elf hurriedly agrees 
	- Minksi throws down 3 gold pieces
- The new vehicle isn't built for speed and only goes slightly faster than walking speed 
- Minksi flexes her bicep next to Reed's and is disappointed to find that Reed's is bigger and suggests that she helps push the boat 
	- Reed says, "I'm plenty good at pushing boats," then pushes it, significantly increasing its speed 
	- Minksi responds, "I know you are"
- Earl the river elf says comments on the smoke coming from the other boat, then tells them to get the little one to help as soon as possible 
	- He says, "There's a small embankment town about half day's river ride up from here, you might one to stop to see if they have any professionals with expertise for whatever your son has"
	- Minksi thanks Earl and tells him that there's sharks on the diesel ship that will kill him if he lets him through 
	- Earl is surprised hear that there's sharkin this far up, and that someone must have really pissed them off; to which Minksi says they really ran though the town nearby
- The party cruise quietly up the river stream that is larger and slightly safer from hazards from now, with two paths: one that is also one of the main throughfares for this river, or a smaller, more obscure path 
- Minksi asks Reed if she can handle a few bumps in the road, and Reed says, "Captain Minksi, I can handle a few bumps in the road. I can handle a lot"
	- Minksi says, "I know you can," then leads the boat down the smaller path 

## Feel My Blood Enraged
- Finn looks at the tents on the sides of the river, but doesn't see anyone 
- The party's ears split from the roars of cannons firing at the party and pushing smoke into the air
- Reed deftly adjusts the rigging and increases the boat's speed and says, "Stick next to me, Mr. Tony"
- Captain Minksi yells at the people firing the cannons to hold their fire because they're just passing through, and to save it for the sharks coming this way 
	- She is met with jeering laughter
	- She orders the devil to make the boat go faster, and it says that it can only make the boat go if it's one piece 
	- She tells it to make the piece it's in go faster 
- Tony looks around the ship for parts he can use Mending on, and sees that the boat is taking on water 
- Finn tries to help Tony bail out the boat, but is inexperienced with boats
- The boat rocks to a complete stop as if it hit something, but they don't see anything obvious 
	- A loud squack-ish, but growling voice in broken Common says, "Surrender. Give us all you have in your boat and walk away with your lives"
- Captain Minksi says, "Look, buddy. I'm the captain of the boat. Take all you want in it, it's all fish in here. I have 6 gold pieces to my name. Save your fire for the huge diesel ship heading this way, they have plenty of gold"
	- The voice tells her to give them the boat and fires again 
- Finn says, "I don't know if the boat is worth this"
	- Minksi tells the party to fight for this boat as if it's their own arm and leg 
- Reed sees that the boat has been caught in a large chain and manages to pull it out a little, but not enough to set the boat free. She then moves closer to Captain Minksi 
- Captain Minksi uses her Feline Agility to jump into the water to look for where the chain is attached; where she sees three camouflaged kobolds who seem surprised when they see her leap out of the water 
	- She pulls out her claws, "If you little lizards don't drop the chain and run right now, I will unleash all the devils in all the hells on you"
- The kobolds quiver for a moment before fleeing into the forest, leaving the chain mechanism unguarded. Minksi deactivates it, then gets back onto the ship 
- The smoke clears, revealing the remains of unlucky river runners and a number of hungry-looking sharks and eels in the water 
- Minksi asks Tony if he thinks they can get one of the cannons onto the ship, or if it'll be too heavy 
	- She looks in the water for loot 
- Tony knows that they can potentially get one of the cannons on the boat with some repairs, but in the boat's current state it might split in two 
- Captain Minksi says that she has something for Reed, but she politely declines and says, "You don't have to get me anything, captain"
	- Minksi asserts that she's giving it to her, and hands her a really nice-looking fishing rod 
	- Reed says, "Thank you, captain. I don't like owing people favors. I'll repay you some time. I could teach you how to fish"
	- Minksi yells, "I know how to fish! I fished for 21 years for my lousy father, only for him to take those fish and put them into cans!"
	- Reed says, "I'll make you breakfast instead"
	- Minksi says, "I have breakfast now! I just went through a brunch phase," to which Reed asks what brunch is, and Finn explains 
- Finn looks around for wood to repair the boat and finds 5 hull patches, 2 sails, 1 bottle of devil oil, 100 GP, and a small statue of a strange god
	- The statue is semi-androgynous and fertility-esque, but also slightly sea creature-like and made of a slimy, green coral stone 
- Reed takes the hull patches and takes time to fix up the ship, while Captain Minksi licks herself clean, and Tony Mends what he can, then starts looking around 
	- Tony doesn't find much, but does find 5 more gold pieces 
- Captain Minksi puts the statue up on the boat high and lofty, then locks it down

## Is It Fast Enough So We Can Fly Away?
- Finn looks for more devil oil, then finds two more bottles
	- Devil oil is very valuable and enhances the ability of ships, can go sell for 100-1,000 gold pieces 
- Captain Minksi knocks on the devil's cage and offers it some of the "sauce"
	- Minksi and Finn argue over how much oil to give to the devil, who says that they have to give him at least a bottle to see any effect 
	- She pours a bottle in, and the party is knocked forward as they suddenly blast off 
- The party sees a large rusty ship turn the corner just as they gain speed 
- The party goes maximum speed for several hours before they reach the river embarkment town that the sea elf had spoke about 
	- The devil oil wears off, and the devil must rest to regain its strength; leaving the party with only the manual speed of the boat 
- Captain Minksi uses her Navigator Tools to approximate how far the diesel ship is and determines that they don't have too long to stick around 
	- She asks the devil how long it needs to rest, and gets a snore in return 
- A tall man in a trench coat and a large fedora blocking his face offers to sell the party 10 gold piece devil oil 
	- Finn says that he'll probably sell them piss oil 
	- The man says he sells the most premium devil oil at the lowest price 
- Finn says, "Hey, captain. Are you really going fucking to trust this guy?"
	- Minksi presses on in asking the man to see his wares, who says, "You're a very good captain. A very wise captain," and she starts purring in response 
- The man pulls out a suitcase full of oils, that Captain Minksi deftly rips away from his hands; then he falls over, and three kobolds scurry away into the bushes screaming curses and vengeance 
- Captain Minksi examines the devil oil, then pours a drop of it on her dagger and lights it on fire 
	- Finn pulls out one of the bottles he found at the camp and compares it against what they've obtained and finds that they seem to burn differently, but it's hard to tell if it's a matter of quality or substance. They both taste and smell like they would be lethal to consume
	- She tells Reed to carry the chest, and she readily agrees  

## All The Other Real Ones That I Destroy
- The town has a tavern, fishing shop, general store with an attached surgeon room, and a very small militia outposts
- Reed says that she will wait at the tavern with the chest, and Minksi says, "You don't even want to check out the fishing store? Seriously? Does nobody want to go shopping with me?"
	- Reed responds, "I have everything I need to fish"
- Tony and Finn join Captain Minksi in checking out the general store, which sells goods, performs surgery, and gives haircuts
- Captain Minksi is surprised at the variety of services the general store proprietor offers, and he says that they're all conducive to each other 
- Tony asks the man can fix him, and he asks why he would want to change his perfect, immortal porcelain form 
	- Tony asks what kind of beard he would grow, and the man says he could give him flesh and hair 
- Finn and Captain Minksi tell Tony that he's fine the way he is, and the proprietor agrees 
- Captain Minksi asks the proprietor if he has any glass eyes, and says she wants something cool and menacing 
- Tony says, "Captain, would you let me operate on you instead of him?"
	- Minksi says she would, and he says "I don't work with anyone you don't know. The boy should be worshipped and maintained for all that he stands for"
- Captain Minksi asks about her eyes options 
	- "Why rebuild you to something worse than what you were when we could make you stronger. Better."
- The proprietor pulls out several strange looking eyes 
	- He points one at an object and blasts it with a small fire beam 
	- He pulls out one made of stone, but carved with runes all over it He says, "A very rare runic magic of the giants. Yes, yes. It will grow with you. At first when you choose, you can remain perfectly alert. Later, you may even learn the magical auras. See twice as far as a hawk, and twice as close as a microscope"
	- He spits a third one out into his hand, "We have a regular old eyeball. Wait, you wanted a glass one," then spits out a glass eye 
	- He says, "The fire eye will run you 1,000 gold pieces, and the runic eye will run you 100,000 gold pieces" 
- Captain Minksi asks if she can pay him on a payment plan for 50 GP a week 
	- She pulls a dagger out on the man and says, "Listen, old man. Give me the fire eye for 100 GP," and he says "My surgical oath prevents me from taking any harm"
	- She offers him 50% of the mystical treasure they find 
- The proprietors says, "I've been examining your boy prince and believe I can replace one of his limbs for a real baby limb. Let me hold one of your arms, you'll be closer to a real boy, I can examine it, then I can make you a real boy when you return"
	- Tony asks if the arm will grow hair, then becomes apprehensive that it won't grow in tandem with him
- Tony asks if he can make is so the arm will help him or teach him 
- The proprietor says, "This is a simple test of the flesh world. You can make your decision when you return. Don't you want to know what it's like to feel the wind? The cool water against your hand? The warmth of your tea in the morning?"
- Tony asks if there's anything else in the general store they can add to their cart, then asks Finn if he needs anything, but he says he's good with his swords 
	- Tony says that he wants surgeon tools, and is offered a freshly sharpened silver surgeon tools, but Tony says he has a bias towards ceramic tools 
	- The man says he doesn't have ceramic tools yet, but will when he returns
- Tony offers more than just his hand, offers his arm for the surgical tools 
- Tony and Captain Minksi receive a long, strange surgery, and learn that the man's name is Dr. Barber 
	- Finn asks what his middle name is, and Dr. Barber says, "I dare not speak of it"
- The runic eye feels very odd in Captain Minksi's eye socket 
- Tony says, "I was going to take something, but I don't feel like he will return my arm if I take something from"
	- Tony swings his new baby arm around and wiggles his fingers around 
	- Tony excitedly says, "I can hear my bones cracking inside of it!"
	- "Captain Minksi replies "That's... great. That sounds awesome"
	- He touches Finn's face with both of his hands, and only the baby arm his warm 
- Finn says, "Wow, you're almost a real boy"
	- Tony says, "Almost? I just want a human body. I want a body.... Preferably humanoid"
	- Captain Minksi asks if he would take a cat body, or a halfling or gnome body 
	- She says, "Would you accept a gnome body even if the body was that of a wretched, disgusting, degenerate whore?"
	- Tony says that he doesn't have private parts, but would accept them even if they were gross and nasty 
	- Minksi says, "Maybe I can introduce you to my stepmother and a different surgeon and sort something out"
- Captain Minksi looks for smoke in the sky, but it's too dark to see anything. She asks if they should sail out, or if they should stay the night 

## And We'll Get Something Started
- The party rejoins Reed at the tavern where she is sitting with a greasy looking human at a back table that offers some privacy 
	- It's a small area with only a couple random river drunks 
- The man with Reed tells the party to step away. Captain Minksi asks her if she's hiding anything from them, and Reed says, "Captain, I wouldn't dare"
	- Minksi takes a look at Reed and sees that she's fucked up 
- Captain Minksi tells the man to back off her friend, and he says, "The deal is off!" and calls Minksi a square 
	- Minksi smashes a bottle against the man's head in retaliation, and he crumples onto the table 
	- Minksi tells Reed that the man won't bother her anymore, and she says, "Thank you, captain. I don't know what I would do without you"
- Captain Minksi argues with the bartender, who just responds in a flat tone

>[!redacted]


- Loud brusque, guttural voices joking with each other loudly sit down at a table and demand drinks from the bartender. The voices have the unmistakable quality of a sharkin 
- Finn quietly pulls the curtain shut so they can discuss what to do next 
- The sharkin talk loudly about the scores they've gotten, the sweeet revenge they're going to get on the small town yokels that dared defied them, make goat jokes about the bartender, and demand meat and alcohol 
	- They mention someone in particular, the only one they sound potentially respectful to, a Captain Splitfin, but they're almost unwilling to speak his name 
- Session ends as the party whispers about their next
