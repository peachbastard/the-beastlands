# What Happened? 
## I Can't See It In The Night 
- A gurgling black mess comes to the top, doesn't come out, but tries to eat the statue
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] runs in front of Reed and yells, "Stay behind me, Reed!"
	- Reed says, "I don't need you to protect me, Captain Minksi"
	- Minksi retorts, "I'm not trying to save you, I'm trying to get that boon"
	- Reed tells her, "It's not a boon, captain. It's something cursed. It's not a boon," but Minksi insists that it is one 
	- Reed says that she doesn't need a boon, and that Minksi can have any boon that it offers, but it won't be good 
- Captain Minksi steps forward and puts her hand in the black ooze and is horrified when it instantly destroys the entire thing bones and all
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] looks around the room and finds that it's very austerely decorated, but otherwise empty 
- Captain Minksi tries to shoot a bolt at the ooze, but it's instantly destroyed and the ooze doesn't recoil 
- Captain Minksi looks at her missing hand and says that all good captains have a hook hand, then becomes despondent and says that she's been a terrible captain 
	- Reed says, "You're a great captain, captain," and Minksi thanks her and tells her that she forgives her for being an asshole yesterday 
- The black ooze starts moving towards
- Reed says, "I apologize for my actions. I had a bad dream last night and it was partly the reason for my behavior, but that doesn't excuse it"
	- Captain Minksi says, "I had bad dreams last night too, but you don't see me acting like an asshole!"
	- Reed retorts, "I said partly!" and trails off and doesn't explain the rest 
- Captain Minksi orders Reed to help her open the door as the black ooze surges towards them 
	- The door is still partially open, but Minksi gets stuck trying to get out and calls for Tony and Finn to help 
- Captain Minksi hears Reed says "doom" in Elvish and asks what she's talking about 
	-  Reed points out an ancient, frantic carving in Elvish of the word on the back of the door 
	- Minksi asks Reed why she didn't point it out when they first came in, and Reed says she didn't see it 
	- The two of them try to get more information out of it, but have to drop it as the black ooze moves closer and instantly dissolves Angelina 2 into nothing
- Captain Minksi almost manages to get out the doors, but gets stuck 
	- Tony screams as she sees her handless arm emerge from the doorway and yells for Finn to come help 
	- Finn and Tony manage to pull Minksi out 
- Reed's larger frame makes it harder for her to get out and she gets stuck 
	- Captain Minksi reaches out and deftly pulls her out of the temple 
	- A drop of the black ooze splashes onto Reed's back as she's pulled out, dripping down and dissolving her clothes and flesh where it touches; leaving one of most impossibly terrible smells she's ever encountered even after a lifetime of working with fish guts
- The party pushes the door a hair closer, and the ooze starts to come through a thin crack 
	- Reed takes a few steps back and slams into the door and shuts it 
- Captain Minksi tells Tony and Finn that she's forgiven Reed now, and to adjust their perceptions of her accordingly 
	- Reed says, "You don't have to forgive me, Captain Minksi. Forgiveness should be earned through action, not words"
	- Minksi tells Reed that her saying that she's a good captain helped her get through the temple, and affirms that she's been forgiven
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] hears the faint, but constant sound of something dripping, and the party sees that some of the black ooze is still managing to make its way through the seam of the doors 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony Garp\|Tony Garp]] tries to set the ooze on fire to evaporate it, but nothing happens 
	- Finn stabs it with his shortsword and the sword is instantly destroyed 
	- Reed pokes at it with the inscribed longsword pilfered from the underwater cave, and part of it is destroyed
	- Seeing this, Captain Minksi tells them that they need to leave 
	- Tony says, "We have to wait for Angelina!"
	- Minksi and Reed break the news that Angelina was destroyed in the temple. Reed says that she gave her life to save them 
- As the party leaves, they can still hear the faint sound of dripping

## Encrypting The Stars
- The party tries to bring the back down a narrow, reedy section of river, but there's a marble pillar in the way
	- Reed tries to push it, but it weights several tons and she's only able to shift it a few inches 
- Captain Minksi wakes up the devil and asks him how much gold it will cost to make the boat jump over the pillar 
	- Finn offers it Captain Minksi's soul, but it says that it's already been traded 
	- Minksi asks who traded it and to whom, but the devil says all it can see is that it's been traded
	- The devil asks how much money she has, and she whispers the amount in its ear. It agrees, so she tosses all the party's money into the hole 
	- During this time, Tony has tried to takes some of the marble that he notices is virtually indestructible, but it's odd that the temple managed to be destroyed. He finds a small stone of it on the ground and takes it
- The boat shoots up and over the pillar and is now powering through the narrow river 
- There are many colorful snakes with glimmering glinting scales in the river

>[!redacted]


- Captain Minksi tries teach everyone a new sea shanty and orders Tony with his "shrill doll voice" to do the high parts 
	- He tries to do the lowest voice he can manage 
- The party manages to put a good distance from the temple
	- As they travel, Captain Minksi and Tony notice damage to the hull. Tony tries to cast Mending on it, but there's larger parts of damage that can't be fixed, and more complex damage that may need a boatswain's touch. The boat won't immediately be sink, but they are slowed down 
- Reed feeds Muddy some fish guts from her hand, and he takes it more gently and doesn't hurt her for the first time 
	- Reed is concerned and says, "Muddy, are you okay? You don't seem as hungry as usual"
	- Captain Minksi says, "He's finally starting to like you," and Reed frowns and responds, "Finally?"
	- Minksi says, "He's starting to like you more," and tells Reed that when people care about you they don't hurt you; then asks when one would purposefully hurt someone they care about 
	- Reed tells her during training or sparring 
	- Minksi tells Reed that people don't come at each other with intent to kill during a spar, and reiterates that people don't hurt the people they care about 
	- Finn brings up the time that Reed struck Minksi at the tavern, and Reed reiterates that it was to help her sleep
	- Minksi asks Reed if she understands and she responds, "Yes, captain"
- Tony tells Captain Minksi that if she finds him a hand or hook he can infuse it for her 
	- Minksi tells him that if he gives her a good hand she'll give him three gold stars 
	- The party gets in a discussion about the gold star system that ends with Minksi giving Finn a gold star, then taking one away from all of them; resulting in Tony having negative one stars. Reed goes from having two stars to none as she gives her last one to Tony so he can be at zero stars 
- Captain Minksi pulls a reed from the river, tosses it on Finn, and yells, "There's a snake on you!"
	- Finn bursts into tears and starts having a panic attack 
	- Reed says, "Don't worry, Mr. Fairleaf. If you're cursed, we can be cursed together," but he continues to panic 
	- Reed points at Finn and yells, "Muddy, help him!" Muddy pecks him and he screams more 
- The party enters an area with a imposing hyper-realistic statue of a gigantic warrior and remnants of other broken statues
	- Captain Minksi says it's next place on the map 
- They also see a bloodstained cave and Captain Minksi says, "I'm sure there's no adventures or boons or treasures in this cave"
	- Finn says there looks like there's plenty of boons in the cave and insists that they go in  
- Finn and Tony try to identify the statue, but can't think of who it may be despite how incredibly detailed it looks 
- Captain Minksi acquiesces and says they should have an adventurous spirit, then looks and sees a snake hiding in the shadows 
	- She pets it and tells Finn that he should be more accepting of snakes. The snake wraps her arm and nuzzles its head against her  
	- Tony yells, "It's attacking the captain!" and Minksi tells him to stay back and puts it on her head 
	- Minksi says that she can use it as her new hand 
	- Minksi asks the party what she should name the snake and Reed says, "Snakey"
	- Minksi doesn't respond to Reed, but just silently glares at her, then announces that she's naming it Gummy 
	- Gummy jumps into the water then pokes its head over the boat 
- Captain Minksi hypothesizes that, "Once upon a time there was a place of great snakes and panthers, and it was a place where people would get their boons. This army were going here to get their boon, but the slugs were jealous and turned to army into stone" 
	- Minksi asks if anyone else has any theories about the cave 
	- Reed says she doesn't, but that the best way to form a solid hypothesis is to gather more data 
	- Minksi asks Reed if she wants to go to school, and Reed says, "Yes, I would very much like that, captain"
- Tony takes half of a stone statue and the arm of an adolescent 

## Moral One, You've Been Chosen
- Captain Minksi enters the cave first on all fours with Reed behind her, then Tony, then Finn at the rear
- There's nothing in the first room besides more statues. Captain Minksi tries to see if there's any particular look to them all, and sees that some have a look of distress 
- Finn recounts what his uncle told him about women in the hills that will turn you into stone and take your soul 
	- Minksi asks if they do anything else to you while you're turned to stone, and if they're beautiful 
	- Finn tells her that they just eat your soul, but are very beautiful 
- A sonorous voice from just around the corner of the stone in accented Common says, "Intrepid adventurers finally come to save me from my unending torment?"
	- Minksi stands up, dusts herself off, and straightens up her collar, then unbuttons the first button of her shirt 
- Captain Minksi turns the corner and suddenly freezes. A beautiful woman steps forward with slow, graceful steps in a gown with a strange gold headdress and trails a finger around her now stony body
	- Tony feels a strange stiffness in his body, but doesn't turn to stone. Reed is able to resist the allure of the woman's gold eyes and the golden eyes of the snakes she has for hair, and Finn is unaffected from around the corner. He closes his eyes 
- Reed approaches with her eyes closed and asks the woman what the cause of her unending torment is, and the woman tells her that it's hunger 
	- Reed says, "What do you hunger for? Oh.... souls," and the woman smiles and confirms 
	- Reed gestures at Captain Minksi and says, "You don't want her then, her soul's already been traded away," but the snake woman doesn't care
- The woman says, "You little fools. Your mere souls are nothing compared to the feasts I've had"
	- Finn asks, "Then why do want them?"
	- She responds, "That's not for the cattle to decide," then attacks 
- Finn manages to hit her with his dagger 
- Reed's sword glows gold as she tries to strike the woman down, but she's just able to deflect it 
- Tony tries to help, but is turned to stone 
- In her haste to attack Reed and Finn, the snake woman trips over a piece of statue and falls prone 
- Finn lands a Sneak Attack on her and Reed lands an attack 
- The snakes on the woman's head rush at Reed, but she's able to bring her shield up and stop them in their track just as they're about to bite her 
- With the snake woman's attention on Reed, Finn advances with his eyes open and strikes her 
- Reed attacks her again in a flurry of glowing golden strikes
- Finn hits her again with his eyes closed
- The woman's snakes turn on her head and bite Finn as she faces Reed
	- The snake woman bleeds green-gold and hisses to Finn, "Join me in killing your friend," and promises to teach him ancient secrets
- Finn refuses and the snake woman says, "You fools, do you have any idea what I've seen in this world?"
- Reed misses again and a bead of drool drops down Captain Minksi's statue 
- Finn is bloodied as he attacks with his eyes opened and shoves his dagger directly in her heart. She grabs his shoulders and looks deeply into his eyes, and for a moment he can see everything she's seen before he turns to stone as she crumbles into dust

## What's Hope With No Savior?
- Reed is left alone in the cavern with a stone Captain Minksi frozen in place as she pops her collar, Tony looking on in fear, and Finn mid-stab 
	- She looks around the room for something to fix them and finds a lot of extremely interesting looking gear on the statues, but they've been turned to stone 
	- The snake woman left behind nothing but her golden headdress 
- Reed turns to Gummy and says, "You gotta help me. I was bit by a snake, that basically makes us blood brothers," and Gummy just looks up, tilts his head, and flicks his tongue out at her 
- Reed takes some time to ponder her next steps loud to Gummy, who simply flicks his tongue in response 
	- Gummy perks up in interest when Reed offers to introduce him to Muddy, and she sternly says that if he tries to eat Muddy she will kill him
	- She eventually looks around the room for the least intimidating statue and finds one of an infant 
	- She takes the golden headdress and puts it on the infant statue, but nothing happens 
	- She then takes the headdress and puts it on top of Gummy, but nothing happens as he confusedly slithers around in it  
- Reed puts on the golden headdress and hears Captain Minksi rambling about different soda flavors, and happily greets her 
	- The petrified party members can't see and can only communicate with Reed when she puts on the headdress and concentrates on them 
	- Minksi orders her to bring their bodies to the ship and take them to the nearest town to find someone to fix them
- Reed picks up the rest of the party members and the infant statue and brings them onboard, then opens the hatch to the devil's cage and calls out to him in Infernal 
	- The devil says he only takes orders from the captain 
	- Captain Minksi orders Reed to cut off her left hand and offer it to the devil so it'll bring them to the next town 
	- Reed tells the devil that he doesn't have anything to offer him, but she does have drugs
	- The devil excitedly demands that she give it the drugs and he'll do it
- Captain Minksi protests, but Reed pulls off the headdress and cuts off their connection
	- Reed says she'll give it a dose, and she's also going to take one 
- Reed drops a pill into the devil's cage and pops one into her mouth then goes to put the headdress back on, but the devil tells her to keep it off for a second

>[!redacted]


- Now wired, Reed puts the headdress on and tells Captain Minksi that she got the boat going 
	- Minksi tells Reed to find a temple or a church with someone that can change them back 
	- Reed says, "My ma and pa said that the gods aren't real, and I believe them because I prayed to a god once. Then my ma cut my hand off"
	- Minksi tells her that other people believe in gods, and that gives them magic powers 

## A Certain Sense of Liberty
- The devil speeds the boat over to a small riverside town while Reed cheers and shouts, "This is the best day of my life!"
- Reed excitedly talks about getting more drugs from the town and Captain Minksi stops her and reminds her about her goal of turning the party back to flesh 
	- Reed asks if she'll get more feeding stars if she does. Minksi starts to correct her again about how the gold stars aren't for food, then pauses and says yes, and that she'll give her five gold stars, but she'll give her negative five gold stars if she doesn't
	- Minksi tells Reed again to find a church or temple so that someone can help them 
	- Reed asks what they need the help for, and Minksi says to turn them back into flesh, and to not fuck it up 
	- Reed asks Minksi how she would define fucking up, and Minksi deadpans, "I remain stone forever"
	- Reed tells Minksi that she's going to introduce Muddy and Gummy, then firmly says that if Gummy does anything to Muddy she will kill the snake 
	- Reed asks Minksi what she's supposed to do, and Minksi exasperatedly repeats that she needs to find a church or temple with someone that can fix them
-  Reed whoops and jumps off the boat and is immediately greeted by a tall man in dark clothing
	- The man tells her he's on the way to the next town to sell his premium goods at a marked up price and asks if she wants to trade at a discount before he does so 
	- Reed tells him that she doesn't have any gold, but does have a sword 
	- Reed hands over the inscribed longsword and receives a small sack in return 
	- As the man leaves, Reed wishes him good luck on his future business endeavors, and the man tells her to shut up 
- Reed enthusiastically tells Captain Minksi about the sack she obtained, and that she doesn't know what's in it, but it appears to be made of burlap or linen 
	- Minksi aggravatedly tells Reed to keep looking for a church 
- Another man approaches Reed and asks if she wants to trade 
	- Reed tells him that she does and asks if he has drugs, and specifies, "I want the cut stuff. None of this uncut nonsense. The other stuff is what makes it fun"
	- The man sounds offended as he says, "Of course I know that! I've lived on the river my whole life. I'm not an amateur"
	- Reed offers him one of the bottles of devil oil they obtained from the kobolds, and the man asks what she wants in exchange for it. Reed tells him she wants drugs, and as much as he can give her 
	- The man gives her 5 doses of pixie dust and leaves 
- Exasperated, Captain Minksi tells Reed to stop buying drugs and go find a church 
	- Reed wonders out loud what would happen if she were to put the drugs in Minksi's mouth while she's a statue 
	- Minksi tells her to save it for when she's a person again and they can do them together. Reed agrees and looks for a church 

## From A Heart Made of Steel 
- Reed finds an old-looking church in a state of disrepair and knocks on the door 
	- A dreary voice calls out and says, "If you're hear to steal something, you can just leave. Anything worth stealing has already been taken"
	- Reed says, "I'm not a thief. I'm here to do the opposite of stealing. I'm here to give you something"
- The door opens and a tired old man opens the door and asks what she wants 
	- Reed asks if he's a man of god, and he says that the gods are dead and what he does is akin to listening to the sounds of a conch shell 
	- Reed says, "So you are a man of god," and the man confirms that he once was, but his flock has long disappeared 
	- Reed gets off-topic and the man closes the door again 
- Reed knocks on the door and the man reluctantly opens it again 
	- Captain Minksi tells Reed to repeat exactly what she says, but Reed goes off-script and has the door slammed in her face again 
	- Reed says that she needs help because her friends are cursed, and the man asks what kind of curse. She says that they're all stone, and the man says he doesn't want to help a bunch of drug addicts
	- Reed protests and says she's the healthiest she's ever been as she's very obviously high  
- Captain Minksi grits out, "Tell him that I'll suck his dick if he fixes us"
	- Reed blurts out, "Do you wanna get your dick sucked?"
	- The man says, "No! I have decency. Now leave," and closes the door again 
- Reed knocks on the door and asks if he wants to see her snake 
	- The man says, "No, snakes are a bad omen," and Reed backtracks and says it was a snake that she had killed. The man shuts the door 
- Reed knocks on the door and says she needs help fixing her friends' curse 
	- The man opens the door and asks what's wrong with them 
	- Reed says, "They've been turned to... rock" 
	- The man says, "Oh, why didn't you say so?" and tells Reed that he can help them, and asks if she has experience with giant man-eating birds 
	- Reed says, "I have experience with a small man-eating bird," and the man responds, "Good enough," and tells her that he will cure her friends, but they have to kill a giant man-eating bird that has been terrorizing the town 
- Reed takes the man to the boat, and he leaves and returns with a contract and Scrolls of Greater Restoration that he had made before the gods died 
	- Reed signs the contract with her blood, and the man uses the scrolls on the rest of the party and the infant and turns them back into flesh 
- The infant cries and babbles in a language that is not Common 
- The man says that they have to kill the giant bird or, "Your friend will go blind. And lose her limbs. And become morbidly obese. And malnourished. And pregnant. With eldritch abominations. I expect this done by the next day," and leaves 
- Reed asks Captain Minksi if she gets "feeding stars" for curing them
	- Minksi sighs and tells Reed again that aren't for food, unless she wants a really extravagant meal; and that they can be exchanged for a kiss from her, gold, a favor, or having someone killed
	- Reed says, "I get plenty of kisses, and I can kill others just fine"
	- Minksi tells Reed that a kiss from her could be lifechanging 
- Session ends as the party considers their next steps
