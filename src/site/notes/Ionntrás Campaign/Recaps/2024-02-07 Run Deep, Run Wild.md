# What Happened? 
## A Bit Too Insane
- The river in the morning is when its more hospitable to smaller life without the carnivorous eels
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] has woken up early and is sitting cross-legged on the water in just shorts and a sports bra with the tip of her sword pointed to her heart
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] wakes up and sees her with a start and yells, "Don't kill yourself! It's not Suicide Sunday!"
	- Reed says, "Good morning, Captain Minksi. I was just training with my sword. I got you something," then pulls up a fish that she had caught, "I said I would get you breakfast"
	- Minksi says, "That's true, you did. Last night was rough. Not my finest captain moment"
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony\|Tony]] reveals a homunculus that he's been working on all night made of a composite of body parts 
	- Captain Minksi tells Tony to get away from it and rushes forward with her two daggers
	- Tony says that it's his first attempt at creating life
	- Finn asks if it's alive, and Tony says, "It's alive! Can't you see it moving?"
	- Finn asks what its name is and suggests Stitch; while Minksi suggests Angelina
- Reed feels a small mudlark nuzzle against her leg and feeds it some fish guts, but does so too excitedly and it gets scared and spits a powerful gush of water that could knock an adult down, which Reed dodges. The mudlark bites Reed's arm and hangs off it
	- Captain Minksi asks, "Did everyone get a new pet overnight?"
	- Reed says, "We can share it if you'd like, captain," but Minksi declines 
	- Reed says, "I've already named it. Muddy," to which Captain Minksi sarcastically says it was very original and says she would have named it Muddy Buddy 
	- As Muddy hangs off Reed's arm, she says that it's helping her train 
- Captain Minksi asks Reed what she's already training for, then tells the rest of the party about how she was training for suicide this morning 
	- Reed says, "My pa says it's important to have a bond with your weapon. Look what I can do now," then throws her finely-made sword into the river 
	- Captain Minksi shouts, "What'd you do that for?" and jumps into the river to retrieve it 
	- Reed murmurs, "[[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Riptide\|Riptide]]," and the sword reappears in her hand 
	- Minksi says, "Why didn't you tell me you could do that?" and gets out of the water, shakes herself on all fours like a cat, and wrings out her tail 
	- Reed offers to help dry her off and Minksi says, "Don't touch me"
- Captain Minksi draws a mustache on Stitch and then on Tony 
	- She tries to give an inspiring speech about how they're going into uncharted territory, but no one is inspired 

## Don't Let's Start
- After a few hours, the party makes their way to a wayfarer left unattended with a sign in Common saying to attend to their boat and help themselves to a wagon 
- Captain Minksi asks Reed if she knows how to hitch the boat to the wagon and she says, "I do, Captain Minksi. I've been doing it since I was young. My ma and pa said that I couldn't get the boat out of the water, I'd have to stay in the river"
- Reed pulls the boat out with the help of Stitch while Captain Minksi watches with her hands on her hips 
- Captain Minksi tries to lead the party in a shanty, but Tony fumbles the lyrics 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] mentions that he was a gardener and a cook at a shanty house, but doesn't know any shanties himself, and could play a fiddle if he had one 
	- Captain Minksi declares him the crew's fiddle boy and says that every good ship should have one 
- As the party continues, they come across a brick wall where a hill giant has fallen asleep in the middle of the road with a magnificent-looking sword in its teeth
	- Captain Minksi knows that giants live around the Seven Splinter Peaks, has never seen one, but knows that it's rare for them to be this far from the mountains 
- Captain Minksi says that if they wake him up he'll probably be very reasonable and maybe join their crew 
- Finn knows that giants are historically onery creatures at the best of times, and even worst in the morning when they wake up 
- The giant yawns and the blade in its teeth glints in the morning light 
- Tony says, "Do you think he ate someone?"
- Captain Minksi says that they should all attack him at once 
- Tony suggests that Captain Minksi could sneak up on it, and he can enchant a rock to say "Ogres suck! Ogres suck!"
	- Minksi says that it's a giant, and that he's racist 
- As the party discusses their next steps, they hear movement in the trees and see a halfling far up the tree that says that the wayfarer must have sent them to rescue him 
	- Tony asks what town he's talking about, and he says it it's called Mayflower 
	- Captain Minksi says that every there is dead 
	- Finn identifies it as about 10 miles up river in the direction they're heading 
- The halfling offers to hire them to help him get rid of the hill giant so he can get his cart across
	- Captain Minksi says that she knows that halflings are known for selling their bodies for gold and says that he could seduce the giant 
- Reed says, "Mr. Tony, I can take care of tapping the rock"
- Tony asks if anyone wants to help him record the message, and he, Finn, and Captain Minksi record themselves talking about how much giants suck 
	- He asks if Reed can tap the rock from 60' away, and she says, "Not quite that far, but I'll make it work"
- The halfling asks, "What are you doing?" and Captain Minksi says, "You've been right here while we talked about it. I've heard that halflings have the smallest brains proportionate to their bodies"
	- The halfling responds, "I've heard that river people are backwards"
- Before she sneaks away from the party, Reed asks, "If anything happens to me, will you take care of Muddy?"
	- Captain Minksi says they will, and Tony says that they'll make sure he lives forever 

## This Is The Worst Part
- Reed hides in a small bush and summons a spectral hand that glows faintly gold appears by the rock and taps it; causing the party's insults to ring out
- The hill giant wakes up and says, "Who said that?" but does not investigate 
	- Reed shoots a bolt of fire at some shrubbery near the rock and sets it on fire, but it still doesn't move 
- Captain Minksi almost snaps a branch, but Finn manages to catch her by the scruff of the neck 
- The hill giant approaches and grabs the halfling by the throat 
- Captain Minksi shoots the hill giant with her crossbow and lands a Sneak Attack
- Finn emerges from the tree and gets his own Sneak Attack against the giant and tries to scale it, but fails and falls prone 
- Tony shoots a dart at the giant, then has Stitch cast Shocking Grasp against it, causing it to fall to the ground as its leg explodes 
- Reed moves toward the prone Finn, then her sword glows gold and she slashes the giant
- The giant tries to get away, then there's a loud boom the giant takes additional damage and its head explodes 
- Captain Minksi goes to take some of its teeth, but they smell atrocious and so she doesn't 
- Finn asks Tony if there's anything from the giant he can use to improve Stitch, and Tony cuts the giant down the middle and takes some parts from it and puts it in his Bag of Holding 
- Captain Minksi takes the sword, which is covered in water ferns and seems to turn into water as she swings it. She takes her rapier and throws it behind her and takes the sword
	- Tony offers to improve her sword, and Minksi tells him to leave her sword alone 
	- Finn tells Tony that he can improve his dagger 
- Finn looks disgusted by the partially-digested bodies they find and starts to sweat
- In its death throes, the giant had squeezed the halfling to death
	- Captain Minksi and Tony search the halfling's corpse and find a medium-sized bag of gold, a wedding ring, and a ruby in its molar 

## Oh Momma, Don't Fuss Over Me
- Reed says, "I've been told to not comment on things that people can't change in 10 seconds, but what happened to your arm, Mr. Tony? I was pretty drunk last night"
	- Tony tells her about how he traded his porcelain arm for a human arm 
	- Reed tells him that she will help him train it, and that her arms looked like that when she first had a sword put in her hands 
- Tony takes Captain Minksi's old rapier and tries to swing it, but isn't proficient with it 
	- Reed tells him that she'll teach him, and recounts how the last time she got her grip wrong on her sword during a spar, her ma took the opportunity to cut her hand off 
	- Minksi asks Reed if she would take the opportunity to cut Tony's hand off if he got his grip wrong on his sword like she took the opportunity to stab her in the chest; and Reed reiterates that it was a slashing motion, and says that it was a learning lesson and she never got her grip wrong on her sword again. She also says that they had her hand reattached 
	- Minksi says that Reed's perpetuating the cycle of abuse, Reed says that her parents weren't abusive and made her stronger. Minksi says she's not any stronger because her stepmother was abusive, and her father never hit her, but did yell at her 
	- Reed says that Minksi's plenty strong, and Minksi takes back her statement and says that they trained her to be the perfect crew member. Reed responds, "Thank you, captain"
- Tony asks if they had her hand stitched or sewn back on, and Reed says that they took her to the church and had it fixed

	- Reed responds, "I think it was a woman"

## I Could Drown In The River

- Reed says, "Mr. Tony, how attached are you to Stitch?" and he says that it was his first successful experiment
	- Finn says that he can learn from the mistakes he made while making Stitch to make a better one, but Tony affirms that he is attached 
- Reed pulls Stitch out of the water, takes a deep breath, then casts Control Water with her [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Bobtail\|magic fishing rod]] to create a whirlpool that sucks in two of the crocodiles 
- Two of the crocodiles attack the boat and nearly do enough damage to bring water into it, but Reed uses her shield to deflect one of their attacks 
- Captain Minksi uses her new sword, which feels effortless and like it's guiding her. The blade turns into liquid, the reach extending to 10' and kills a crocodile

- Tony throws giant guts into the whirlpool and whistles, inciting a feeding frenzy with the crocodiles in the whirlpool 
	- The crocodiles that were attacking the boat follow the guts into the whirlpool 
	- He then tries to throw another chunk to distract the largest crocodile, but it has a look of sentience and hatred in its eyes as it lumbers towards the boat
- Reed jumps onto a rock between the boat and the primordial crocodile and her sword glows gold as she strikes it. This crocodile is older than the rest and covered in a patchwork of scars
- The primordial crocodile whips its tail at Reed and she tries to use Silvery Barbs to stop it, but it launches her in the air, then catches her in its teeth, knocking Reed unconscious and dropping her concentration on the whirlpool

- The smaller crocodiles begin to disperse 

## Them Bones Are Me
- Captain Minksi jumps like a cat back on the boat and asks the devil where it was going, and it says that it thought it was going to get overrun by the crocodile 
- Tony uses his bone saw to cut into the primordial crocodile's body and finds a partially digested body 
	- He searches the body and sees that its wearing some kind of ancient druidic garb, may have been a firbolg, and is wearing a strange ring that seems to be made of roots, but is made of hard, coppery wood 
	- Captain Minksi and Finn ask if there was anything on it and he says, "No, it looks like one of those weird druid hobos"

- Captain Minksi pulls the boat to shore so everyone can get back on 
- Tony ritual casts Detect Magic and sees that it contains ancient druid magic, and when properly aligned by a druid contains great nature magic within it
- Finn patches up the damage on the boat from the crocodiles 
- Tony asks if anyone is nature-y, and Reed says, "My ma and pa used to make me sleep outside when I acted up. Does that count, Mr. Tony?"
	- He responds, "Yeah, nature and survival are the same"
- The party takes a short rest while Tony uses his Right Tools for the Job to manifest carpenter's tools to fix the boat 

## Will God Go Down With It?
- Captain Minksi opens the hatch and says to the devil, "Hey, I got a new brand of devil oil. You want to try some?" she pours three drops down, and thick smoke pours out of the boat and the ship comes to a stop 
	- She throws the kobold devil oil off the boat and tries to give it a bottle of the good devil oil and says, "Devil? Devil?" but there's no response and the smoke gets thicker and hinder her vision of it

- Captain Minksi tries to look inside the hatch, but it's too small
	- She starts freaking out and Finn says, "You killed it"
	- She blames Finn for telling her to get the oil and breaks a bottle of the kobold devil's oil over his head 
- Tony suggests that they open up the bottom of the cage and let some of the oil out 
	- Captain Minksi takes off her eyepatch and makes Finn hold it, takes Tony's tinkerer's tool, activates her [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Rune Eye\|Rune Eye]] that allows her to see in the darkness as if it's day, then jumps into the water and tries to perform an oil change 
- The smoke thins and no longer billows out of the engine 
- Captain Minksi feels something grabbing at her foot and scrambles back onto the boat 
- A faint voice says, "Hey, you got a light?"
	- Captain Minksi lights a candle and puts it down the hatch, then the devil asks for more devil oil. She responds, "Listen, bud. We're rationing here. You get half now and half later"
	- The devil complains about how it's muddy and dirty in there, and Minksi gives it half a bottle of the last of their devil's oil
- The boat begins to move again through canyons that grow and grow until only grey light filters through and the sky cannot be seen. It's only dimly lit by glowing fungi 
- Session ends as the party comes to a sandbank to rest for the night as the devil runs out of energy
