## Throw The Bait
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Finn Fairleaf\|Finn Fairleaf]] tries to discern if the sharkin will be there for a while, and it seems like they may be staying there with more of the crew joining. The two sharkin there are named Redscar and Glor 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Captain Lamp Minksi\|Captain Lamp Minksi]] suggests that they wait until the sharkin fall asleep and steal their ship
	- Finn is concerned that they will get mutilated and tied to the mast
	- Minksi says that they follow river jungle law and would only kill the small and scrawny and leave her, the big and strong
	- Reed protests that she's not small and scrawny, and Minksi says that she forget that Reed has a sleeper build 
- Captain Minksi asks how good the party is at improv, then yells, "I heard someone say that Redscar's mom is a bitch!" and Tony joins in and says, "I heard it was Glor!"
- The curtain slams open and one of the sharkin says, "Who said that?"
	- Captain Minksi says that she heard it from someone when they got here in the morning, and the sharkin says that they didn't get there until just now 
- Captain Minksi shoots her crossbow at the sharkin 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Tony\|Tony]] tries to hit it with his sling, but misses 
- Finn strikes at one of the sharkin's legs and feet with his shortsword and dagger 
- [[Ionntrás Campaign/Party/Reed Primus\|Reed Primus]] slashes at one of the sharkin, but is still plastered and misses 
- Captain Minksi also misses, then Disengages to run through the sharkin, jumps onto the bar and yells, "Who's hungry?"
- Glor strikes at Captain Minksi, but misses 
- Redscar nearly lands a critical hit against Finn, but Reed thrusts her shield out and mitigates some of the damage 
- Tony hits one of the sharkin with his sling 
- Finn misses with his shortsword, then stabs Redscar with his dagger 
- The rest of the people in the tavern have either ran or or are running, with the satyr bartender cowering behind the bar 
- Reed slashes wildly upward trying to cut off Redscar's head, and thick viscous blood falls on her, but he still stands 
- Captain Minksi yells at the bartender, "So you don't drink and you don't fight?" but the satyr ignores her 
	- She then strikes Glor, who retaliates 
- Redscar disengages and moves towards the exit
- Tony tries to shoot his sling at the fleeing sharkin, but misses 
- Finn dramatically whips his [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Cape of the Mountebank\|shimmering cape]] around and teleports into Redscar and the sharkin explodes, spilling gore and shark guts everywhere
- Reed strikes at Glor, takes a deep breath, then strikes again 
- Captain Minksi stabs Glor to death, then asks the satyr if they can have a free room 
	- The satyr yells at them to get out of here and asks, "Do you know what happens when there's blood in the air? I'm gonna be cleaning blood for months!"
	- Minksi says, "Better to be alive and cleaning then cleaning in hell"

## It Was Always Burning
- Tony uses his Disguise Kit to try to scrub the blood off of Finn, but only manages to get a piece of intestine out of his hair
- Captain Minksi says, "A captain's plan never goes awry!" then starts taking bottles of liquor and stuffing rags in them to make Molotov cocktails 
	- She and Finn try to give the bartender gold pieces to compensate him
	- They ask if there's a backdoor, and he says, "I wouldn't pour water on you to put you out!"
- Finn pulls a dagger against his throat and again about the backdoor, and the bartender tells him to go through the backdoor in the storage room
- The party hears the sound of footsteps sloshing through the mud towards the front door as five sharkin approach
- Finn reenters the bar to help, while Captain Minksi and Reed circle around to watch from a window 
	- He sees the bartender being choked by a sharkin, then pulls him away. He yells at the bartender to hide or he'll kill him 
	- One of the sharkin looks both bored and curious, then levels a cannon against Finn and nearly knocks him unconscious
- Captain Minksi holds a crossbow shot until Reed breaks the window 
- Reed uses her shield to break the window open, then Captain Minksi uses this moment to shoot a sharkin
	- Reed uses her [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Bobtail\|magic fishing rod]] to cast Maelstrom on the sharkins' ship
	- Reed yells, "You might want to check on your ship!" but the sharkin clearly intend on killing them first and dealing with the ship later, with two of the sharkin leaving the bar to check on the ship
- One of the sharkin knock Finn unconscious. As he loses consciousness, his eyes meet the bartender's before the satyr's eyes explode as an anchor crushes his skull 
- Captain Minksi yells, "The captain never leaves their crew behind!" and uses her Feline Agility to rush into the bar and to carry Finn out 
	- One of sharkin is surprised and misses, but the other manages to strike her with an iron pipe  
	- She yells, "Bad plan, bad plan, bad plan. Never listen to the crew's plan; only the captain's plan"
- Tony starts running towards the ship and scouts ahead to make sure they don't run into any sharkin 
- Reed sticks her hand through the broken window and shoots a bolt of fire at the liquor, detonating it and causing an explosion 
	- Captain Minksi yells, "Fuck the fey and fuck their businesses! Stay where you came from!"
	- Still unconscious, Finn mumbles, "Captain, you can't say that," and throws up again 
- The party sneak back to their ship, but one of sharkin spot them and shouts, "They're heading for their ship!"
	- The sharkin's ship is still being accosted by the maelstrom, and one of the sharkin approach the party 
- The sharkin says, "We've been looking all over for you. You think you can just spill shark blood and get away from us? None of you are going to get the boat past me. You can get on the boat alive, or in my stomach"
	- Captain Minksi says, "I wouldn't get another step closer, Mr. Shark. I just had the Eye of Shark Slaying installed in me," and she lifts her eyepatch to reveal her [[Ionntrás Campaign/Inventory/Rune Eye\|Rune Eye]] 
- The sharkin says, "You're a liar," and takes a step back 
	- Captain Minksi responds, "Oh, but I'm not. My eye longs for the salty flesh of your kind!" and takes a step forward 

## Up She Rises
- Captain Minksi forgets to put Finn down and Reed is still very drunk as they struggle to get the boat out of the dock 
	- The party gets stuck getting out of port for a while, and by the time they start heading out of the river they can see the sharkin's boat beginning its pursuit 
- The party must cross the Giant's Steps: a series of large waterfalls they must head down before they can head down 
- Captain Minksi knocks on the devil's hatch and says, "Hello, Mr. Devil! We've got an emergency!"
	- The devil says, "It's always an emergency when it comes to you people," and yawns
	- Minksi pours one of the good bottles of devil's oil down the hatch; which keeps the boat safely ahead of the other's, but not able to lose it completely. A huge billowy cloud of diesel smoke pours out of the sharkin's engine as it keeps pace 
- Captain Minksi asks Reed, "With your boating knowledge, do you think we can go fly this waterfall?"
	- Reed responds, "My ma and pa say you can try everything once"
- The party is only barely able to make it past the first waterfall and sees the large sharkin ship barreling into the second set of waterfalls 
- Tony ties a rope around himself, Finn, and the ship
- The ship takes on damage from the waterfalls and starts to take on damage; while the other ship is so huge that it's able to navigate the falls 
- Captain Minksi says, "Um, devil, about making the ship fly. How many of my body parts do you need to make the ship fly?"
	- The devil laughs and says that it doesn't know
- The party starts taking fire from the sharkin's cannons as the other ship catches up 
- Tentacles begin to rise out of the water
- Captain Minksi orders the crew to get to their stations and start bailing out the ship 
- Finn scoops water out of the ship, then spots where the hole is and shouts for Tony to start fixing the ship 
- Tony casts Mending on the hole 
- Reed holds the Wavecaster's Fishing Rod and casts Shape Water to bail the rest of the water out of the ship 
- Captain Minksi takes over the manual mechanisms of the ship and is able to swing out of the way of the tentacles 
- The sharkin ship tries to ram the tentacles, but isn't successful and is halted 
	- It then fires its cannons on the party's ship and knocks Tony unconscious 
- The party is able to get out of sight as the sharkin ship is busy with the tentacles 
- Captain Minksi sings, "What do we do with a drunken sailor, what do we do with a drunken sailor, what do we do with a drunken sailor?"
	- Reed finishes, "Early in the morning!"
	- Minksi says, "Clearly Reed is the only one on the ship with sailing experience"

## Time Marches On
- Reed spots a bend in the river that looks like it might be a safe place to rest, then Captain Minksi directs the ship there to set up camp 
- Captain Minksi asks if anyone knows any good ghost stories
	- Finn doesn't have any and starts cooking 
	- Reed says, "My ma used to say that if I didn't eat my vegetables a ghost kraken would take me in the middle of the night"
	- Minksi says, "Reed, your whole life sounds like a ghost story," to which Reed responds, "Thank you, captain"
- Captain Minksi asks Finn about his mom, and he says that she died giving birth to him 
	- Minksi says, "Well, if she was anything like you are, she must have been okay for a halfling"
	- Finn is unsure if he should take that as a compliment or not
- The party hears the sound of a bell ringing down the river towards them 
	- Reed sees a small boat with a solitary figure on it 
- The boat pulls up with a slim humanoid figure with a black cloak, black mask, and black belt ringing a bell 
	- He says, "Woah there! I happened to be sailing down the river selling my goods and wanted to see if you wanted to buy my wares or had any food to spare"
- Captain Minksi says they have food to spare, but the last person that tried to sell them something was three kobolds stacked together, and orders Tony to shake him down
	- The man says, "I am quite uncomfortable with human contact," and Tony says that he's not a human
	- Minksi asks, "Would you let me doll touch you?" and the man declines 
- As the party talks about the three kobolds, Reed asks, "What do you have to sell, sir?"
	- He has general goods, fishing supplies, health potions, a Decanter of Infinite Bees that he got from some kobolds, and a True Lucky Coin that will bring true luck when you need it
- Reed says, "Well, sir, I don't have much gold to offer you, but you can have this fish for free"
	- Finn passes out the food he's been cooking
	- Reed asks, "Mr. Fairleaf, is there vegetables in this food? You know... the ghost kraken" 
	- Finn assures her that there are, in the form of some leaves in the shitty fish stew
- The man gives them a discount for giving him the fish, and the party purchases two Common Potions of Healing for a total of 80 gold pieces, and the man leaves 
	- The potions are distributed to Finn and Tony, and Finn takes offense to being told that it's because he keeps dying
- Session ends as the party takes a long rest just a ways from the next wayfarer where the treasure map begins
